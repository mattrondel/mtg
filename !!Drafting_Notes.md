**** Draft basics ****

Caverns- $10 + takes

start @630 till 10

starting with left pick 2 cards (or 1)

once packs are depleted then pass to the right repeating process

Drafting is idea for 8 players but isn’t strick to it just allows for elimination when doing the typical 3 rounds best of three

Even number of players recommended.

Draft tips:

B.R.E.A.D. - this is to teach you priory of what to pick

Bombs: - your opponent’s biggest threats. If your opponent’s cannot get rid of them they will "go off" and win you the game

How do you know if it’s a bomb? 

Is this a big creature, preferably one that is hard to block (added evasion), basically things that have a strong impact on the board?

Things to ask when choosing:

Does the card have a significant effect or ability that provides you with significant card advantage? 

Card advantage is defined as a player having access to more cards than another player, usually by drawing more cards through in-game effects. You can also achieve through causing your opponents to discard cards, and to a lesser extent simply by mass removing cards from their battlefield. 

Does this card provide game-breaking effects, such as that of planeswalkers

Removal: Counterspells, destroy, or exile effects. Removal removes the threat. Bounce spells like return target creature to owners’ hand are removal.

Combat spells and tricks can be used as removal as well. Pumping your creature so that it can now block and kill an attacker is a form of removal as is flashing in a creature strategically for surprise blocking. 

Evasion: Attackers that can prevent opponents from blocking. Flying, menace, horsemanship trample, etc. being able to attack without the possibility of your opponent’s blocking is partially strong. 

Aggro: creatures that are neither bombs, nor have evasion, but apply pressure and can fill holes in your mana curve. Sometimes these are cards that have weaker abilities that don’t win you the game, but help you win the game. Aggro is sometimes called ability cards. Aggro should be taken with mana curve in mind. Aggro could also be called anything else

Dirt -Your worst cards. Your duds. The cards you would never, ever play. Typically, dirt tends to be all that is left in the remaining 5 or so cards but this varies. Dirt can sometimes have a role in your sideboard. Your sideboard is all the cards you drafted but did not use in your deck.  Sometimes dirt can be situational cards that you might sideboard in between games. 

****************

Alternate break down more simplified?

Bombs: creates that have a strong impact on the board and can help swing the game in your favor even if your behind

Removal – spells that destroy creatures or make your opponent’s creatures a little bit weaker.

Mana Curve – you want to have something to cast on every turn, so you need to conscious of how many two, three, four and five drop (total casting cost) creatures you’re choosing for your deck. Once your done drafting you can pick and choose creatures to make your mana curve as smooth as possible

Synergy: How cards in the set work together if you have a card that makes a copy of itself 

**** Points of Courtesy / Rules – Still in Development ****

### No Hate Drafting ### 

This means drafting a card out of a pack that you zero intention of playing or putting in as sideboard/alternate. The only reason you’re taking it is that you’re keeping it from somebody else at the table. 

### No Shiny card Syndrome ###

Don’t take a card simply because it’s big, flashy and/or a mythic rare take it because it will work well in your deck. 

### No Copy Limit  ### 

There is no limit on how many copy of a card can be in a deck – if you draft 10 poison dart frogs you can play them all

### Keep Quiet ### 

Don’t talk about the contents of your pack that you’re looking at this is giving up a lot of information what’s in the packs.

### Zone Draft ### 

There is a "zone" between each player and in each player's hands. No more than one pack can be in a zone at once. So if the player to your left hasn't picked up the pack you passed them, you're not allowed to pass them another pack

•	Don't pass until somebody is ready

•	Zone Drafting isn’t to make things more competitive, it’s to keep things organized so there are less problems all around.

There may not be more than one pack between players.

if by chance a pack builds up then "tap" the pile this is to prevent a train of piles



Essentially you've got three zones:

•	Pass zone: You collect from one pass zone to your hand, and then when you're done drafting from that pack, put it into the next pass zone (passing left for the first pack, right for the second, and left for the third).

•	Hand zone: View the cards, and take one that you want to put in your draft zone, then pass the rest of the pack.

•	Drafted zone: Your pile of cards that you've drafted.

Only one pack of cards can be in a pass zone or a hand zone. If there's a pile up. If your outgoing pass zone is still occupied, you hold onto the pack in your hand until that outgoing pack moves along; and there doesn't end up a pileup on one player

Zoning don’t pass your packs too fast for the person you’re passing to. Look at the person you’re passing to and you see if they have a pile they haven’t gotten to yet, if they do then just hold onto yours and wait for them to pick it up before passing that way they don’t feel rushed and the piles don’t get confused. 

“zone drafting”. After you pick, put the rest of the pack down between you and the next player, and wait for that zone to be clear before making your next pick and putting down the next pack.

Suggestions:

*************

Don’t lock into colors right away when you first start drafting e.g you pick Red and Green because those are your favorite colors


A 40 card deck is your goal and an idea setup is as following:

About 16 creatures

About 7 non creature spells

About 16-18 lands per 40 card deck

24-25 lands in a 60 card deck

Mana curve – you want to cast a creature every turn if possible or you want to have creatures with varying mana costs. 

Mana curve template:

1-2 mana = 5-7 cards

3-4 mana = 7-10 cards

5-6 mana = 1-2 cards

8+ mana = 0 cards

13 creatures are absolute minimum 16-17 is ideal.
