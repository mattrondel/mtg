Open Notepad++.
Press Ctrl + H to open the Replace dialog.
In the "Find what" field, enter: \[[^\]]*\]\s*
Leave the "Replace with" field empty.
Make sure the "Search Mode" is set to "Regular expression".
Click on "Replace All".

Explanation of the regular expression:

    \[ matches the opening square bracket.
    [^\]]* matches any character that is not a closing square bracket ] zero or more times.
    \] matches the closing square bracket.
    \s* matches any whitespace characters (if any) after the closing square bracket.

This regular expression will match any text enclosed within square brackets and the square brackets themselves, and replace them with an empty string effectively removing them.

After performing the replacements, your text should look like the desired output you provided.
