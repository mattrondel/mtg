*youtube tips*
add a dig through time
remove 4 opt
add 2 wolfwillow haven and 2 bala ged recovery
remove a forest (in replace of one of the bala ged)
25 lands seems deck 
removing the remaining opts go with omniscience and emergent ultamatium 

add one blast zone
remove basics with dual lands
most decks play with botanical santium and barkchannel
so add 4 of each


Considering for lotus field deck
2 Bala Ged Recovery
1 Baral, Chief of Compliance
4 Barkchannel Pathway
1 Blast Zone
1 Boseiju, Who Endures
4 Botanical Sanctum
1 Dark Petition
