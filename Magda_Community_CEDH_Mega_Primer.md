Primer

**Introduction**

Introduction

One of the most enticing parts of playing Magda is that you have the ability to tutor for a game winning combo in the command zone.

Unfortunately there are many things that can get in the way when trying to use your Magda activations to find that winning line, at least depending on your board state and how many times you get to use your commander's ability to tutor.

That being said the goal is always to get to "infinite treasure" or even pseudo infinite through a variety of lines. From this position you should be able to close out the game on the spot or generate a board state that is going to be extremely difficult/next to impossible to fight through for your opponents.

There is a lot of nuance and knowledge required to win through many "stax" pieces, some of which many Magda pilots run themselves.

This primer is going to broken down into the following sections because of this fact;

Combo "Starters" - Making Infinite Treasures

- Basic means of Generating Infinite Treasures (Staxless)

- Generating Infinite Treasures Through Varying Stax

- Alternative Means Of Generating Infinite Treasures

Important Combo Adjacent Information - Things You Need To Know When Trying To Win The Game

- Elixir of Immortality Outlets
- Elixir of Immortality Draw Loop & Burn
- Tel-Jilad Stylus Outlets
- Maskwood Nexus Specific Outlets
- Engineer & Welder Loops (Damage & Destruction)
- Dualcaster Mage
- Other

Each section/combo will also be accompanied by a video for visual representation. This is for those players that learn better from video format over a text guide.

The reasoning behind combos being broken up in this manner is because getting to infinite treasures should lead to a win under almost all circumstances, its just about choosing HOW you want to win after that point depending on what win conditions your specific deck variant chooses to run.

This primer will eventually go over A LOT more than just combos, but as combos are one of the most important aspects of the deck to understand this is where we are starting.

Glossary

    AD (Artifact Dwarf) = Any "Shapeshifter"/"Changeling" or artifact creature that can be named as a dwarf on ETB. Roaming Throne, Universal Automaton, Metallic Mimic are some examples. You can also make any dwarf into an artifact through varying means such as Liquimetal Torque
    Stax = Anything that limits play in some fashion such as Null Rod , Doorkeeper Thrull, Rest In Peace Grafdigger's Cage, Blind Obedience, Drannith Magistrate, Yasharn, Implacable Earth, Blood Moon, Collector Ouphe, Archon of Emeria ,Rule of Law ,Torpor Orb, God-Pharaoh's Statue, Static Orb ,Winter Orb
    RT = Roaming Throne
    Clock Combo = Clock Of Omens Loop that generates infinite treasures.
    Tap Outlet = Any vehicle such as Clown Car that can be crewed or Dwarven Bloodboiler that has an activated ability requiring tapping another dwarf.
    Shatter = Anything that can remove an artifact Mogg Salvage, Zoyowa's Justice, Abrade etc.
    DCM = Dualcaster Mage
    Crime Queen = Magda, The Hoardmaster

Combo "Starters" - Infinite Treasures
Basic means of Generating Infinite Treasures (Staxless)

**Clock Of Omens Loop**

Clock of Omens is an artifact that allows us to use any "Artifact Dwarf" as a means to generate infinite tapped treasures which can convert to infinite untapped treasures through a few means.

This requires a board state of Magda, Brazen Outlaw + Clock of Omens + any Artifact Dwarf (AD)

    Tap Clock of Omens + Artifact Dwarf such as Adaptive Automaton targeting the automaton with Clock's ability to untap it. This will trigger Magda, Brazen Outlaw when the AD is tapped as part of the cost to use Clock's Ability which will generate an untapped Treasure
    You will then tap the AD and the newly made Treasure targeting your AD which will trigger Magda, Brazen Outlaw again in order to untap your AD generate another untapped treasure Treasure. This leaves you with one untapped treasure, an untapped Artifact Dwarf and a tapped Treasure
    From here you continue this loop of tapping the new untapped Treasure and the Artifact Dwarf to use Clock of Omens ability targeting the Artifact Dwarf in order to generate infinite tapped Treasure and leave you with one untapped Treasure
    Win the game from here with infinite Magda, Brazen Outlaw activations that lead to varying Combo Enders

The most common second step will be to make infinite untapped treasures by using either Roaming Throne or Maskwood Nexus + Xorn and repeating the Clock of Omens loop generating an extra untapped treasure each loop and then performing your preferred "Combo Ender."

Its important to note that things like Liquimetal Torque and Mirror of the Forebears can act as ways to either copy a dwarf as an artifact creature or simply make an existing dwarf on your board into an artifact with Liquimetal Torque's ability.

**Maskwood Nexus + Battered Golem**

Maskwood Nexus provides our deck a way to turn our non-dwarf artifact creatures into dwarves while also giving us a way to use our vehicles as artifact dwarves after they have been crewed.

This combo is very simple.

You need Magda, Brazen Outlaw + Maskwood Nexus + Battered Golem in play along with any means of tapping your dwarf/creature such as Dwarven Bloodboiler or any vehicle via the Crew Ability like Clown Car

Once they are on field do as follows:

    Tap Battered Golem to crew your vehicle or activate Dwarven Bloodboiler's ability. This will then trigger Magda, Brazen Outlaw to generate a Treasure as Battered Golem is now considered a dwarf as Maskwood Nexus makes all creature every creature type. The Treasure entering the battle field will cause Battered Golem to untap and be able to be tapped once more.

This is the simplest way to make infinite Treasure because they will all be untapped unless there is something forcing them to come into play tapped like Dauntless Dismantler.

Generating Infinite Treasure Through Varying Stax

Grafdigger's Cage

Grafdigger's Cage is an annoying card when it comes to potentially winning the game for many decks. For us it stops our ability to take creatures out of our deck which in turn means that it can be hard to navigate winning. Creatures are especially important to generating infinite untapped treasures in most scenarios such as Battered Golem, Roaming Throne, Xorn and the rest of our Artifact Dwarf suite under normal circumstances but are not actually required to be tutored out of our deck to allow us to actually make infinite treasure.

We can easily generate infinite treasure through this particular stax piece using some tech that was alluded to in the Clock of Omens section above; Liquimetal Torque or Mirror of the Forebears

    We first need to get either Liquimetal Torque or Mirror of the Forebears. So in most situations this will require using Magda, Brazen Outlaw's activated ability.
    Next you tutor out Clock of Omens if it is not already on the battlefield.
    Then you use Liquimetal Torque to turn any of your dwarves into an artifact (including Magda) or alternatively activate Mirror of the Forebears to become a copy of any dwarf on the battlefield under your control (including Magda).
    Once you have an artifact dwarf on field along with your Clock of Omens you can combo off like you normally would with your Clock of Omens Loop.

From here you will have infinite tapped treasures. You will then either remove the Grafdigger's Cage with something like tutoring Spine of Ish Sah or using a "Draw Loop" to get something like Abrade to hand if you have the mana to cast it (or tutor extra artifacts that generate mana//to be used with Clock of Omens to untap treasures) in order to destroy the Cage which will open up your ability to make infinite untapped treasure (Don't forget to tutor out all your things to make it harder to interact with your casting the destruction spell like God-Pharaoh's Statue and other taxing effects/stax pieces.

Alternatively you can go for some of the more intricate non-creature lines known as "Rube Goldberg" lines and in some cases "Sacrifice Loops" if your deck is running Elixir of Immortality. These lines will be covered later in this guide.

Artifacts Enter Tapped - Blind Obedience, Root Maze, Dauntless Dismantler (And Other Variants of this Effect)

Dauntless Dismantler is being seen in many meta decks just like Blind Obedience has seen a rise in popularity. This type of effect is important to many decks because they want ways to control their opponent's ability to use and abuse treasures. They effectively pseudo shut down many Dockside Extortionist loop variants among other varying combos requiring things to come into play untapped like Underworld Breach lines that include Grinding Station + Mana Vault.

Unfortunately we don't have many ways around this outside of finding a way to remove the piece that is in our way . In many cases if that is Dauntless Dismantler we can be held hostage by it's ability to remove all of our treasures at instant speed, although if they are doing so its being done before we get to make infinite treasures.

The main line for getting around the generic effect of artifacts entering tapped uses Maskwood Nexus and Battered golem. Unlike our clock of omens loop needing at least one untapped treasure to continue looping Battered Golem just needs to be able to untap itself by having an artifact enter, which luckily for us Battered Golem counts itself when it enters like Grinding Station does allowing you to not need any other artifacts to enter after Battered Golem comes into play to begin comboing off.

So in order to deal with artifacts ETBing tapped you need to have Magda, Brazen Outlaw + Maskwood Nexus + Battered Golem + Dwarven Bloodboiler//Any Vehicle.

If you have to tutor for Battered Golem it will enter untapped (just like Grinding Station). So it can immediately be tapped to trigger Magda, Brazen Outlaw to generate a Treasure to untap them again and continue the chain regardless of if the Treasure enters tapped or not. If Battered Golem is on field it should be untapped but if for some reason it is not you can tap any dwarf in any manner to generate a Treasure and allow you to tap Battered Golem to begin a loop.

    Tap Battered Golem to crew Vehicle or activate Dwarven Bloodboiler and to generate a Treasure via Magda, Brazen Outlaw's trigger which will enter tapped due to the STAX effect untapping Battered Golem allowing you to tap them again to generate another treasure...untapping them.
    Make infinite tapped Treasure by continuing the loop in step 1. Tutor for Spine of Ish Sah to destroy the STAX forcing artifacts to enter tapped or continue to step 3 and onwards to make infinite tapped treasures without removing the piece stopping you.
    Tutor out Clock of Omens along with one of the following Cursed Mirror// Mirror of the Forebears//Sculpting Steel. Have Cursed Mirror or Sculpting Steel enter as a copy of Battered Golem or activate Mirror of the Forebears to have it become a copy of Battered Golem untapping the original Battered Golem and the new copy.
    Use Clock of Omen's Ability tapping both Battered Golem targeting a tapped Treasure triggering Magda, Brazen Outlaw twice making two more tapped Treasure and untapping both Battered Golem.
    Repeat step 5 until you have infinite untapped treasure and win the game.

If an opponent is attempting to use Dauntless Dismantler and you already have infinite treasures you can simply tutor out any artifact to reset the normal loop used with Battered Golem in response to the ability and then win over the top as long as you hold priority any time their ability is reached on the stack.

If you want to tech specifically for this situation you can also run Amulet of Vigor in your deck, however its up to personal preference and my opinion is that it's not necessary.

Artifacts Cannot Be Activated (Karn, Ouphe, Null Rod effects)

Effects like Collector Ouphe and Null Rod are a lot harder to navigate due to our deck primarily getting it's ability to tap creatures through vehicles. Unfortunately CREW is an activated ability of an artifact and so is the ability on Clock of Omens

This leaves us with one line... which is funnily enough the exact same as when dealing with artifacts ETB tapped however because we cannot use vehicles we must use Dwarven Bloodboiler

So in order to make infinite treasures through Null Rod like effects you do as follows;

    Assemble Magda, Brazen Outlaw + Maskwood Nexus + Battered Golem + Dwarven Bloodboiler
    Tap Battered Golem to use Dwarven Bloodboiler's ability and generate a treasure via Magda, Brazen Outlaw due to Maskwood Nexus making Battered Golem a dwarf. The Treasure will enter untapped and will also untap Battered Golem letting you tap it once more to Dwarven Bloodboiler and continue this loop to generate infinite treasures
    You then have two choices

    To remove the STAX piece stopping you by tutoring Spine of Ish Sah with Magda, Brazen Outlaw's activated ability or alternatively get Professional Face-Breaker and use it's activated ability to turn your infinite Treasure into impulse drawing your deck to then cast something like Abrade or Lightning Bolt depending on the card type of the STAX piece stopping you to enable your win from there. Alternatively you can get Plundering Barbarian out instead by first getting Maskwood Nexus if your list includes him.
    Have a combo that works though these effect types. EX: Terror Of The Peaks combos.

Alternative Means Of Generating Infinite Untapped Treasures
Elixir Based Lines - Sacrifice & Rube Goldberg

Sacrifice lines are extremely complicated however they are a way that you can generate infinite untapped treasures through Grafdigger's Cage as many of them do not require additional creatures to do so.

These lines primarily revolve around using Elixir of Immortality and pieces that can be put in the graveyard in some fashion like Lotus Petal//Unlicensed Hearse//Spine of Ish Sah to allow you to continue doing Clock of Omens loops after generating infinite tapped treasures by continually allowing untapped artifacts to be used for the activation of Clock of Omens along side any AD (Normally Mirror of the Forebears or a dwarf that has had Liquimetal Torque used on them).

It can be taken in another direction with the same base concept and abuse the legend rule to force things into the graveyard as well by using things like Mox Amber//Mox Opal//Eriette's Tempting Apple//The One Ring//God-Pharaoh's Statue (essentially all legendary artifacts work) along with Sculpting Steel. You can also abuse the legend rule by using Mirror of the Forebears alongside Cursed Mirror in combination with our commander Magda, Brazen Outlaw.

Because these lines do focus on the graveyard some can still be done including creatures such as Dwarven Scorcher or other creatures that can force themselves or another creatures you control into the graveyard.

The setup/line written for Cursed Mirror in combination with Mirror of the Forebears was written by Irarueland his guide can be found here and I've been given permission to use portions of his guide here. I've kept the rest of the lines in the same writing style for consistency sake.

There are more combinations that can be used other than these listed below however these are the most common and consistent.

The only requirements to make these sorts of loops work is that you essentially have a way to generate the mana or excess treasures to use elixir of immortality to loop whatever choices of artifacts you use that can find their way into the graveyard somehow (either in conjunction with legend rule + sculpting steel or having a way to put itself there like > Sacrifice costs such as Lotus Petal) while still generating excess treasures above that activation cost requirement through crewing a vehicle or using the Clock of Omens activation in conjunction with an artifact dwarf with the artifacts being looped as described in the examples below.

Eriette's Tempting Apple + Sculpting Steel + Vehicle (ex: Clown Car)//Dwarven Bloodboiler + Lotus Petal

Setup

    Get to infinite tapped treasures via Clock of Omens loop. This leaves you with one untapped treasure to start.
    Tutor any Vehicle that can be crewed by our artifact dwarf. (For this example we will use High-Speed Hoverbike)
    Tap artifact dwarf to crew High-Speed Hoverbike
    Resolve Magda, Brazen Outlaw trigger creating a Treasure.
    Tutor Eriette's Tempting Apple, on ETB target our artifact dwarf.
    Using Clock of Omens, tap Eriette's Tempting Apple and the artifact dwarf to untap the artifact dwarf.

    Resolve Magda, Brazen Outlaw trigger creating a Treasure.
    Tutor Lotus Petal and sacrifice floating
    Tutor & Activate Elixir of Immortality using the floating and a treasure.
    Sculpting Steel, Lotus Petal and Elixir of Immortality get shuffled into library.
    Repeat this loop netting 1 treasure each loop for infinite untapped treasure.

Spine of Ish Sah//Lotus Petal + Unlicensed Hearse +Dwarven Scorcher & Maskwood Nexus

Setup

    Get to infinite tapped treasures via Clock of Omens loop. This leaves you with one untapped treasure to start.
    Tutor Maskwood Nexus

Loop

    Tutor Dwarven Scorcher
    Tutor Spine of Ish Sah ETB targeting itself.
    Before the ETB resolves, using Clock of Omens, tap Spine of Ish Sah and the artifact dwarf to untap the artifact dwarf.
    Resolve Magda, Brazen Outlaw trigger creating a Treasure.
    Resolve both Clock of Omens activation and Spine of Ish Sah ETB.
    Hold priority responding to the Spine of Ish Sah LTB.
    Tutor Unlicensed Hearse

    Resolve Magda, Brazen Outlaw trigger creating a Treasure.
    State-based action Unlicensed Hearse dies to having 0 power.
    Use Dwarven Scorcher Ability targeting itself, to sacrifice itself.
    Tutor & Activate Elixir of Immortality using two of the three generated treasures.
    Repeat this loop netting 1 treasure each loop for infinite untapped treasure.

This line can replace Spine of Ish Sah with Lotus Petal and generate 2 treasures each rotation (clock from hearse + crew from scorcher) and one from using petal each repetition still netting you one extra treasure each loop since one treasure must be used in conjunction with the mana from petal to use Elixir of Immortality

Setup

    Get to infinite tapped treasures via Clock of Omens loop. This leaves you with one untapped treasure to start.
    Tutor Maskwood Nexus

Loop

    Tutor Lotus Petal, Dwarven Scorcher & Unlicensed Hearse
    Tap Unlicensed Hearse and the artifact dwarf to untap the artifact dwarf.
    Resolve Magda, Brazen Outlaw trigger creating a Treasure.
    Before the LTB resolves, using Clock of Omens, tap Unlicensed Hearse and the artifact dwarf to untap the artifact dwarf.
    Use Dwarven Scorcher to crew Unlicensed Hearse
    Resolve Magda, Brazen Outlaw trigger creating a Treasure.
    State-based action Unlicensed Hearse dies to having 0 power.
    Use Dwarven Scorcher Ability targeting itself, to sacrifice itself.
    Use Lotus Petal and sacrifice floating
    Tutor & Activate Elixir of Immortality using one of the two generated treasures and the from petal.
    Repeat this loop netting 1 treasure each loop for infinite untapped treasure.

Magda, the Hoardmaster + Maskwood Nexus + Vehicle//Dwarven Bloodboiler

The downside to this line is that it requires you do to it during your own turn since it can only be done at sorcery speed. This variant is specifically to generate infinite treasures to allow you to win at instant speed without going to combat, though this is a win-con itself due to the creatures generated by Magda, the Hoardmaster having haste and can attack that turn.

Setup

    Get to infinite tapped treasures via Clock of Omens loop. This leaves you with one untapped treasure to start.
    Tutor Maskwood Nexus
    Tutor Magda, the Hoardmaster
    Tutor any Vehicle//Dwarven Bloodboiler

Loop

    Sacrifice 3 tapped treasures to use Magda, the Hoardmaster's ability generating a 4/4 red Scorpion Dragon creature token with flying and haste.
    Tap Scorpion Dragon to crew any vehicle or use Dwarven Bloodboiler's ability (this can be done because the dragon is also a dwarf).
    Resolve Magda, Brazen Outlaw trigger creating a Treasure.

Eriette's Tempting Apple + Sculpting Steel + Goblin Welder - Your Head Judge Might Hate You

This section is primarily written by Iraruel as well and includes the relevant rules text.

Required for Loop:

    Eriette's Tempting Apple
    Goblin Welder
    Sculpting Steel
    Maskwood Nexus
    Magda, Brazen Outlaw

Starting state discussion:

The starting state for this loop has Goblin Welder, Maskwood Nexus, Magda, Brazen Outlaw on field and one of Eriette's Tempting Apple and Sculpting Steel on field and other in graveyard or hand. Casting it from hand we can copy Eriette's Tempting Apple and legend rule one of them to the graveyard to start the loop from that state.

    Activate Goblin Welder targeting Eriette's Tempting Apple on field and Sculpting Steel in yard to swap.
    Magda, Brazen Outlaw triggers, as Goblin Welder is a dwarf from Maskwood Nexus, creating a treasure.
    Since the swap happens at the same time we make Sculpting Steel enter as a Eriette's Tempting Apple. (See Rules and Combo Tips Section)
    Sculpting Steel copy of Eriette's Tempting Apple triggers as it enters targeting Goblin Welder to untap it giving it haste.
    Repeat generating a treasure each loop.

Notes:

There are some awfully scuffed rulings around this loop as Goblin Welder works in mysterious ways, so if you're running this loop it would be worth keeping note of the relevant rulings found in the Rules and combo tips section, so the inevitable judge call goes a bit more smoothly. The video below discusses the above variant of the combo and another variant that works regardless of how a judge might rule in regards to Sculpting Steel being able to enter as Eriette's Tempting Apple if both are being chosen for Goblin Welder ability with Sculpting Steel being in the graveyard.

Original Combo Credit: Rust ITG

Judge Friendly Variant

The starting state for this loop has Goblin Welder, Maskwood Nexus, Magda, Brazen Outlaw on field and one of Eriette's Tempting Apple and Sculpting Steel on field and other in graveyard or hand. Casting it from hand we can copy Eriette's Tempting Apple and legend rule one of them to the graveyard to start the loop from that state.

This variant however uses treasures every other repetition when sculpting steel is in the graveyard to circumvent requiring potential judge rulings. If there is a judge called it will be on the part where sculpting steel is entering as a copy of apple, so you can easily pivot to this variant as well in that situation.

Setup

    Tutor//Play Sculpting Steel to field as a copy of Eriette's Tempting Apple putting the Eriette's Tempting Apple in grave
    Activate Goblin Welder targeting Sculpting Steel and Eriette's Tempting Apple
    Magda, Brazen Outlaw triggers, as Goblin Welder is a dwarf from Maskwood Nexus, creating a treasure.
    Eriette's Tempting Apple enters untapping Goblin Welder
    Activate Goblin Welder targeting Treasure and Sculpting Steel in grave
    Sculpting Steel enters as Eriette's Tempting Apple legend ruling the original to the graveyard and untapping Goblin Welder

Loop

    Activate Goblin Welder targeting a Sculpting Steel on field and Eriette's Tempting Apple in grave.
    Magda, Brazen Outlaw triggers, as Goblin Welder is a dwarf from Maskwood Nexus, creating a treasure.
    Eriette's Tempting Apple enters untapping Goblin Welder
    Activate Goblin Welder targeting Treasure and Sculpting Steel in grave
    Magda, Brazen Outlaw triggers, as Goblin Welder is a dwarf from Maskwood Nexus, creating a treasure.
    Sculpting Steel enters as Eriette's Tempting Apple legend ruling the original to the graveyard and untapping Goblin Welder

Important Rules Text Credit to Shodokan from the Magda Discord.

Essentially what happens is that during the resolution of Goblin Welder's ability the game is forced to simultaneously resolve a replacement effect during another event which is not possible as the replacement effect must occur before it can enter and the sacrifice and entering happen simultaneously which is not possible with a replacement effect unresolved.

Because its done simultaneously and instantaneously while a replacement effect is occurring the game relies on rule 616.1e to allow the replacement effect to occur which forces attempts to re-resolve the ability as this clause must happen. So the game state is forced to re-wind slightly and then re-apply with the new information gained from the replacement effect of sculpting steel to allow the ability to fully resolve. This essentially means that while Sculpting Steel is being used in a Goblin Welder swap that when its chosen it just is the thing you want it to be due to how the game forces these interactions to occur as long as Goblin Welder's ability will resolve.

*616.1e Any of the applicable replacement and/or prevention effects may be chosen.*

Referencing 614.12a, if a replacement effect that modifies how a permanent enters the battlefield requires a choice, that choice is made before the permanent enters the battlefield. Hence because the resolution of Goblin Welder's ability with a clone requires a replacement effect to occur it is not possible to complete due to the checks required during replacement effects (see 616), so the replacement effect is completed before it can continue to resolve. The game state must be referenced at the beginning of event 2 in which X artifact is still on board, then after the replacement effect is done you can finish resolution of the ability

There is a big difference between events and SBA checks. Because SBAs won’t be checked in between the events but the board will be able to be referenced by relevant things like clones in between.

614.12. Some replacement effects modify how a permanent enters the battlefield. (See rules 614.1c–d.) Such effects may come from the permanent itself if they affect only that permanent (as opposed to a general subset of permanents that includes it). They may also come from other sources. To determine which replacement effects apply and how they apply, check the characteristics of the permanent as it would exist on the battlefield, taking into account replacement effects that have already modified how it enters the battlefield (see rule 616.1), continuous effects from the permanent’s own static abilities that would apply to it once it’s on the battlefield, and continuous effects that already exist and would apply to the permanent.

Cloudstone Curio Loops

Cloudstone Curio loops are simple. Dockside Extortionist is your main line, so as long as dockside makes at least 1 more treasure than the cost of itself and another creature then you can make infinite treasures.

The other way you can use curio is to have Roaming Throne or Xorn on the battlefield as well as a way to tap your creatures such as Dwarven Bloodboiler or any Vehicle. This lets you use two 1 drop creatures to bounce one another infinitely and generate infinite treasures or Magda, Brazen Outlaw and a 1 drop if you hold priority at the correct times.

Example: Dockside + Dwarf (tap outlet optional based on dockside count)

    1 drop variant requires a Dockside Extortionist count of 4 treasures with no Tap Outlet and 3 with a Tap Outlet (if Magda, Brazen Outlaw is on the battlefield)
    2 drop variant requires a Dockside Extortionist count of 5 treasures with no Tap Outlet and 4 with a Tap Outlet (if Magda, Brazen Outlaw is on the battlefield)
    3 drop variant requires a Dockside Extortionist count of 6 treasures with no Tap Outlet and 5 with a Tap Outlet (if Magda, Brazen Outlaw is on the battlefield)

Example using Magda, Brazen Outlaw and no Tap Outlet (2 drops)

Cloudstone Curio and Magda, Brazen Outlaw on the battlefield.

Setup

    Cast Dockside Extortionist triggering Cloudstone Curio letting you bounce Magda, Brazen Outlaw to hand.
    Dockside Extortionist ETBs generating 5 treasures.

This loop makes an extra treasure every other loop.

Rings Of Brighthearth + Basalt Monolith + Treasure Vault

Rings of Brighthearth lets you copy any ability for 2 mana. So when you use it in conjunction with the untap ability on basalt monolith you end up getting two untaps allowing you to net +1 mana every repetition. From there you simply tutor out Treasure Vault and use the mana to generate pseudo infinite untapped treasures.

This particular line is not used in very many lists however it is used in some lists that have opted to move away from Maskwood Nexus

Setup

Infinite tapped Treasure via some combo like like Clock of Omens and at least 2 mana available.

    Tutor Rings of Brighthearth & Basalt Monolith
    Tap Basalt Monolith for

Loop

    Use Basalt Monolith's ability to untap itself for , hold priority with the activation on the stack and pay to use Rings of Brighthearth allowing you to duplicate the activation of Basalt Monolith
    Resolve Rings of Brighthearth trigger untapping Basalt Monolith, hold priority with the original Basalt Monolith activation on the stack.
    Tap Basalt Monolith generating
    Resolve original Basalt Monolith activation untapping itself.
    Tap Basalt Monolith generating

Once you have done sufficient loops tutor out Treasure Vault and use your pseudo infinite mana to generate as many treasure as you have in your pool. Proceed to win-con of your choice.

Grinding Station + Clock Of Omens + Artifact Dwarf & Grinding Station + Sculpting Steel + Clock Of Omens + Artifact Dwarf - Wincon In A Box

Grinding Station untaps itself whenever an artifact comes into play. So this means whenever Magda, Brazen Outlaw triggers the treasure coming into play will untap Grinding Station. Because of this Grinding Station can be used as a transition into untapped treasures or milling your opponents out. If you are under one of the more annoying stax effects where your artifacts ETB tapped (such as Blind Obedience) you can use Sculpting Steel to circumvent the stax effect and get to untapped treasures if you want to win at instant speed or if you want to still use Grinding Station as its own win condition.

Basic Setup

The variant that doesn't need to fight through stax is more of a pseudo win-con than it is a means of generating untapped treasures. Its susceptible to opponents trying to win with things such as Born Upon A Wind + Thassa's Oracle

Clock Of Omens, Magda, Brazen Outlaw and an Artifact Dwarf (Such as Universal Automaton)

Setup

    Get to infinite tapped treasures via Clock of Omens loop. This leaves you with one untapped treasure to start.
    Tutor Grinding Station

Loop

    Restart Clock of Omens loop using Grinding Station and the Universal Automaton
    Resolve Magda, Brazen Outlaw trigger creating a Treasure triggering Grinding Station to untap.

You can then proceed to use your untapped treasures and Universal Automaton to continue the Clock of Omens loop, with each Magda, Brazen Outlaw trigger on the stack you can hold priority and use Grinding Station to mill an opponent for 3 cards, let the Magda trigger resolve which will untap the grinding station allowing you to mill the table.

Fighting Through Artifacts ETB Tapped Stax

Grinding Station Clock Of Omens, Magda, Brazen Outlaw and an Artifact Dwarf (Such as Universal Automaton)

Setup

    Start your Clock of Omens loop by using Grinding Station and your Universal Automaton for Clock of Omens ability.
    Resolve Magda, Brazen Outlaw trigger creating a Treasure triggering Grinding Station to untap.
    Resolve Clock of Omens activation untapping Universal Automaton
    Continue this until you have infinite tapped treasures. Leaving Grinding Station and Universal Automaton untapped.
    Tutor Sculpting Steel, when it enters have it enter as a copy of Grinding Station
    When Sculpting Steel enters as Grinding Station it will untap itself.
    Restart the Clock of Omens combo using your Universal Automaton and one of the two Grinding Stations
    Resolve Magda, Brazen Outlaw trigger creating a Treasure triggering Grinding Station to untap.

Loop

    Tap one Grinding Station and sacrifice a tapped Treasure to mill an opponent for 3.
    Repeat another Clock of Omens activation with the other Grinding Station and your Universal Automaton
    Resolve Magda, Brazen Outlaw trigger creating a Treasure triggering Grinding Station to untap both copies.

Variant 1: Making Infinite Untapped Treasures Through Artifacts ETB Tapped

This line variant is also pretty simple but requires two Grinding Stations and either Roaming Throne or Maskwood Nexus + Xorn

Setup

    Start your Clock of Omens loop by using Grinding Station and your Universal Automaton for Clock of Omens' ability targeting Universal Automaton
    Resolve Magda, Brazen Outlaw trigger creating a Treasure triggering Grinding Station to untap.
    Resolve Clock of Omens activation untapping Universal Automaton
    Continue this until you have infinite tapped treasures. Leaving Grinding Station and Universal Automaton untapped.
    Tutor Sculpting Steel, when it enters have it enter as a copy of Grinding Station
    When Sculpting Steel enters as Grinding Station it will untap itself.
    Tutor Roaming Throne or Maskwood Nexus + Xorn

Loop

    Activate Clock of Omens using your Universal Automaton and one of the two Grinding Stations targeting Universal Automaton. This will result in two Magda, Brazen Outlaw triggers.
    Resolve the first Magda, Brazen Outlaw trigger creating a Treasure and triggering Grinding Station to untap. Hold priority with the second trigger on the stack.
    Activate Clock of Omens by using both copies of Grinding Station to untap a treasure.
    Resolve second Magda, Brazen Outlaw trigger creating a Treasure and triggering Grinding Station to untap.
    Resolve Clock of Omens activation untapping your Universal Automaton

Variant 2: Making Infinite Untapped Treasures Through Artifacts ETB Tapped

This line variant is also pretty simple but requires two Grinding Stations and two artifact dwarves such as Adaptive Automaton and Universal Automaton

Setup

    Start your Clock of Omens loop by using Grinding Station and your Universal Automaton for Clock of Omens' ability targeting Universal Automaton
    Resolve Magda, Brazen Outlaw trigger creating a Treasure triggering Grinding Station to untap.
    Resolve Clock of Omens activation untapping Universal Automaton
    Continue this until you have infinite tapped treasures. Leaving Grinding Station and Universal Automaton untapped.
    Tutor Sculpting Steel, when it enters have it enter as a copy of Grinding Station
    When Sculpting Steel enters as Grinding Station it will untap itself.
    Tutor second Artifact Dwarf such as Adaptive Automaton

Loop

    Activate Clock of Omens using your Universal Automaton and Adaptive Automaton targeting your Universal Automaton. This will result in two Magda, Brazen Outlaw triggers.
    Hold priority with both Magda triggers on the stack and activate Clock of Omens using both Grinding Station to untap a Treasure
    Resolve the first Magda, Brazen Outlaw trigger creating a Treasure triggering both Grinding Station to untap.
    Hold priority with Magda's trigger on the stack and activate Clock of Omens using both Grinding Station to untap Adaptive Automaton
    Resolve Clock of Omens activation untapping your Adaptive Automaton
    Resolve Clock of Omens activation untapping your Universal Automaton

All Lines Covered
Attack Of The Clones - Xorn // Roaming Throne // Academy Manufactor Lines
Roaming Throne and Clones

This particular section is written by Irarule and covers the lines with Roaming Throne, Xorn and Academy Manufactor along with the ways to copy them such as Mirror of the Forebears Sculpting Steel Cursed Mirror and The Mycosynth Gardens

Roaming Throne illustrated by Cristi Balanescu.

This section explores several combos and combinations using Roaming Throne, Xorn and/or Academy Manufactor alongside clone effects like Cursed Mirror, Sculpting Steel and/or The Mycosynth Gardens to greatly increase treasure generated per instance. The first combination is using Roaming Throne and Xorn to increase the treasure generated from Magda, Brazen Outlaw's tap clause, causing each trigger to make an additional treasure with Xorn's replacement effect and also increasing the number of triggers by 1 using Roaming Throne's replacement effect to make 4 treasures per tapped dwarf. By cloning either part of this combo, e.g. 2 Roaming Throne and 1 Xorn, we get 6 treasures per tap allowing us to tutor for more clones to generate even more treasure per tapped dwarf! From this point we can tutor Maskwood Nexus to allow us to tutor Dwarven Scorcher, which alongside Elixir of Immortality, allows us to tap Dwarven Scorcher to generate an absorbent amount of treasure then sacrifice it to shuffle it back with Elixir of Immortality, which will generate infinite treasures.

We can also use Academy Manufactor in a similar but different way requiring it to be cloned to stack it's replacement effect. With 2 copies of Academy Manufactor for example, every treasure generated will create 3 Food, clue and Treasure. This is possible as Academy Manufactor ability is a replacement effect which will replace each time one of a Food, Clue or Treasure is generated with one of each tokens. With 2 of these effects we are first replacing the initial Treasure with a Food, Clue and Treasure, then again replacing those with a Food, Clue and Treasure. That means for each additional Academy Manufactor we're generating an exponential amount of Food, Clue and Treasure, e.g. 3 Academy Manufactor makes 9 of each, and 4 make 27 of each, this can be modelled by 3^(A-1) where A is the number of Academy Manufactor when more than 1.

The previously mentioned Xorn and Roaming Throne also can be used here with 2 Academy Manufactor effects. Xorn in this case will increase the number of generated by a factor of (X+1) where X is the number of Xorn, e.g. 1 Xorn and 2 Academy Manufactor generate 6 of each token, this gives us the formula (X+1)*3^(A-1) for the number of treasure generated when using at least one Xorn (X number of Xorn) and at least two Academy Manufactor (A number of Academy Manufactor). This is because of Xorn being another replacement effect allowing you to first apply it before the Academy Manufactor replacement effects. Using Roaming Throne in this case is much simpler as it just increasing the number of triggers Magda, Brazen Outlaw makes rather than being a replacement effect, and ends up generating the same formula as the Xorn case.

These combinations can then be used in the same way as the Roaming Throne and Xorn combination above to generate infinite treasures the same way. After generating infinite treasure this way we then need to use one of the outlets found in the outlet section, examples of these are looping Eriette's Tempting Apple with Elixir of Immortality or Goblin Welder.

Xorn and Roaming Throne example line:

Xorn illustrated by Yigit Koroglu.

Setup pieces:

    Untapped Magda, Brazen Outlaw.
    A vehicle (e.g. Clown Car)
    Untapped Xorn
    5 treasures for a Magda, Brazen Outlaw activation.

Loop requires:

    Roaming Throne
    Maskwood Nexus
    Elixir of Immortality

Any 2 of these copy effects:

    Cursed Mirror
    Mirror of the Forebears
    Sculpting Steel
    The Mycosynth Gardens
    Flipped Fable of the Mirror-Breaker

Loop as follows:

    Tutor Roaming Throne entering as a dwarf.
    Crew Clown Car tapping Magda, Brazen Outlaw and Roaming Throne.
    Magda, Brazen Outlaw triggers 4 times, 4 Xorn replacement effects makes 2 treasures 4 times.
    Tutor Sculpting Steel to field copying Roaming Throne.
    Crew Clown Car tapping the copy of Roaming Throne.
    Magda, Brazen Outlaw triggers 3 times, 3 Xorn replacement effects makes 2 treasures 3 times.
    Tutor Maskwood Nexus to field.
    Crew Clown Car tapping Xorn.
    Magda, Brazen Outlaw triggers 3 times, 3 Xorn replacement effects makes 2 treasures 3 times.
    Tutor Cursed Mirror to field copying Xorn.
    Crew Clown Car tapping the copy of Xorn.
    Magda, Brazen Outlaw triggers 3 times, 6 Xorn replacement effects makes 3 treasures 3 times.

Loop begins here:

    Tutor a saccable creature to field (e.g. Dwarven Scorcher, Bogardan Hellkite targeting itself with the ETB...).
    Crew Clown Car tapping the saccable creature.
    Magda, Brazen Outlaw triggers 3 times, 6 Xorn replacement effects makes 3 treasures 3 times.
    Sacrifice the creature.
    Repeat for many saccable creatures netting treasures.
    Tutor Elixir of Immortality to field.
    Active Elixir of Immortality shuffling the saccable creatures back into your library.
    Repeat to generate infinite treasures.
    Loop wincon

Alternative "Loop" - No Elixir

    Tutor any creature.
    Crew Clown Car
    Magda, Brazen Outlaw triggers 3 times, 6 Xorn replacement effects makes 3 treasures 3 times.

Repeat loop until you have enough extra treasures to either remove multiple stax pieces stopping another line or you have enough treasures to win the game in some way.

If you have 20 creatures in library this generates 180 treasures and gets you all of your creatures which should be more than enough to dig your way out of any board state.

This video is an overview of how the copy functionality works and the moving pieces in regards to the differences in some board states, copying RT vs Xorn and the impact that may have on your lines.

The video example is better suited to explain non-elixir lines.

Important Combo Adjacent Info

There are some things that are important to understand when trying to win the game. There are going to be stax pieces such as Grafdigger's Cage and Null Rod that can prevent some win attempts from varying Magda, Brazen Outlaw lists. Most lists tend to run their own copy of Grafdigger's Cage as this card is effective against many strategies such as shutting down Underworld Breach lines. The lists running Grafdigger's Cage either need ways to win through it or ways to remove it. The same goes for Null Rod specifically where some Magda lists are on this since mana rocks are such an integral part of EDH and many artifact activated abilities can help propel our opponents ahead even if its only by gaining mana through Treasure.

The most important thing to understand are the pieces we have that can remove things that are stopping us and the conditions by which you might look to go for specific lines. Most of these lines consist of ways to draw your deck until you find the proper interaction to remove whatever is stopping you such as Abrade which can not only remove artifacts but can also remove some creatures that may get in the way of your win attempts such as Manglehorn and Collector Ouphe

Many decks will run the monored Reclamation Sage in our handy Plundering Barbarian as a means of not only allowing us to remove artifacts when played from hand but also potentially tutorable in conjunction with Maskwood Nexus to let us remove our own Null Rod should we find ourself in that position.

Some decks also run Spine of Ish Sah as a catch-all tutorable means of removing any problematic permanent. The only way this is turned off is if someone artifact ETBs are not able to trigger due to things such as Elesh Norn, Mother Of Machines or Doorkeeper Thrull are on the field. Some lists opt to not run this however as they question it's card quality which is also a valid opinion.

Otherwise we can use the following means of digging for answers
Professional Face-Breaker - "Card Draw" through null rod

As this is a creature we cannot tutor this through Grafdigger's Cage

Professional Face-Breaker lets us use our infinite treasures to impulse draw our deck.

Normally this consists of first tutoring any artifacts and or dragons we can to the field that will not impede casting whatever we need to find in order to remove the piece stopping us from winning. This also can mean every creature in our deck as long as we first grab Maskwood Nexus. This is meant to help preserve win lines so that you do not end up exiling things you'd use to win and end up not being able to play them for whatever reason.

Then you can proceed to impulse draw until you hit the interaction you need to remove the problematic piece. Sometimes this can require multiple steps like fist removing Null Rod to enable artifact abilities which allows something like Liquimetal Torque to make anything an opponent has into an artifact, this then allows another of your shatters to remove something potentially forcing your artifact to enter tapped such as Blind Obedience or simply remove something that is still somehow stopping you from making infinite untapped treasures which can then be used for mana based or clock based win conditions.

Draw Loops With The One Ring - Clock Of Omens, Goblin Welder and Elixir Of Immortality Variants

The One Ring is an incredibly powerful card that acts as a way for you to draw through your deck if you have a way to either untap it (Clock Of Omens) or replace it with a copy of itself (Sculpting Steel) which lets you proceed find anything needed to remove a problematic piece.

These lines require an activated ability of an artifact though so they do not work through Null Rod type effects.

Clock of Omens Only Variant

This particular variant is risky because you need to be very precise about the amount of cards in your library so you do not risk drawing yourself out.

Normally you will tutor out anything you can before doing this loop to limit the amount of cards you may need to draw to find your out.

Setup

    Generate Infinite untapped treasures.
    Tutor Clock of Omens (if not on field) & The One ring

Loop

    Tap The One Ring adding a burden counter, Draw X where X is the amount of burden counters on The One Ring
    Tap 2x Treasure to activate Clock of Omens targeting The One ring untapping it.
    Untap The One Ring

Repeat until you find your out(s) and cast them. After doing this you may use Sculpting Steel having it enter as a copy of The One Ring to reset your burden counters when you sacrifice the original The One Ring to the legend rule.

Welder & Clock Of Omens Variant

Does not work through Grafdigger's Cage unless you initially have welder on field. It also pre-supposes you have made infinite untapped treasures via something like Battered Golem + Maskwood Nexus

This particular variant is if you wish to draw one card at a time so that you can not risk any funny business from your opponents.

Setup

    Obtain infinite untapped treasures.
    Tutor Goblin Welder, The One Ring & Clock of Omens
    Tutor Liquimetal Torque or Mirror of the Forebears naming goblin (or dwarf if you have maskwood out).
    Activate Mirror of the Forebears to become Goblin Welder or Tutor Cursed Mirror, enter as a copy of artifact Goblin Welder and use Liquimetal Torque to make the Cursed Mirror copy into an artifact.
    Tap The One ring to draw one card.
    Tutor Sculpting Steel entering as a copy of The One Ring. Legend rule sacrificing the original copy to the graveyard.

Loop

    Tap Cursed Mirror copy of Goblin Welder to activate it's ability targeting The One ring and a Sculpting Steel
    Resolve Goblin Welder ability.
    Tap The One Ring to draw a card
    Use 2x untapped Treasure to activate Clock of Omens targeting Cursed Mirror copy of Goblin Welder untapping it.
    Tap Cursed Mirror copy of Goblin Welder to activate it's ability targeting Sculpting Steel and a Treasure
    Sculpting Steel enters as a copy of The One Ring. Legend rule sacrificing the original copy to the graveyard.
    Use 2x untapped Treasure to activate Clock of Omens targeting Cursed Mirror copy of Goblin Welder untapping it.

Repeat loop until you've found your out(s).

Elixir Of Immortality

Setup

    Obtain infinite untapped treasures.
    Tutor Elixir Of Immortality & The One Ring
    Tap The One Ring to draw a card
    Tutor Sculpting Steel entering as a copy of The One Ring. Legend rule sacrificing the original copy to the graveyard.

Loop

    Tap Sculpting Steel to draw a card
    Activate Elixir Of Immortality shuffling both itself and The One Ring back into your library
    Tutor Elixir Of Immortality & The One Ring
    The One Ring enters. Legend rule sacrificing the Sculpting Steel copy to the graveyard.
    Tap The One Ring to draw a card.
    Activate Elixir Of Immortality shuffling both itself and Sculpting Steel back into your library.
    Tutor Elixir of Immortality & Sculpting Steel
    Sculpting Steel entering as a copy of The One Ring. Legend rule sacrificing the original copy to the graveyard.

Repeat loop until you've found your out(s).

Vexing Bauble//Pyrite Spellbomb//Soul-Guide Lantern//Stone Of Erech Draw Loop

While these loops are normally not used unless it is a budget variant of the deck there are some pilots that still use Pyrite Spellbomb as a win condition.

For every example below I will be using Pyrite Spellbomb however Pyrite Spellbomb Soul-Guide Lantern Stone of Erech and Vexing Bauble all function the same way in that if you can get them from graveyard to the battlefield repeatedly then you can use infinite mana to draw your deck.

Vexing Bauble is now seen in A LOT of lists, so this is very important to know if you're not on elixir and need a specific amount of card draw.

Elixir Of Immortality Loop

Setup

    Generate infinite untapped treasure

Loop

    Tutor Pyrite Spellbomb & Elixir Of Immortality
    Activate Pyrite Spellbomb to draw a card
    Activate Elixir of Immortality shuffling both itself and Pyrite Spellbomb into your library.

Repeat loop until you've found your out(s).

Goblin Welder Loop

Setup

    Obtain infinite untapped treasures.
    Tutor Goblin Welder, Clock of Omens & Pyrite Spellbomb
    Tutor Liquimetal Torque or Mirror of the Forebears naming goblin (or dwarf if you have maskwood out).
    Activate Mirror of the Forebears to become Goblin Welder or Tutor Cursed Mirror, enter as a copy of artifact Goblin Welder and use Liquimetal Torque to make the Cursed Mirror copy into an artifact.
    Activate Pyrite Spellbomb to draw a card

Loop

    Tap Cursed Mirror copy of Goblin Welder to activate it's ability targeting Pyrite Spellbomb and Treasure
    Resolve Goblin Welder ability.
    Activate Pyrite Spellbomb to draw a card
    Use 2x untapped Treasure to activate Clock of Omens targeting Cursed Mirror copy of Goblin Welder untapping it.

Repeat loop until you've found your out(s).

Goblin Engineer Loop

Setup

    Obtain infinite untapped treasures.
    Tutor Goblin Engineer putting Pyrite Spellbomb in graveyard and Clock of Omens
    Tutor Liquimetal Torque or Mirror of the Forebears naming goblin (or dwarf if you have maskwood out).
    Activate Mirror of the Forebears to become Goblin Engineer or Tutor Cursed Mirror, enter as a copy of artifact Goblin Engineer and use Liquimetal Torque to make the Cursed Mirror copy into an artifact.

Loop

    Activate Cursed Mirror copy of Goblin Engineer to activate it's ability targeting Pyrite Spellbomb and Treasure
    Resolve Goblin Engineer ability.
    Activate Pyrite Spellbomb to draw a card
    Use 2x untapped Treasure to activate Clock of Omens targeting Cursed Mirror copy of Goblin Engineer to untap it.

Repeat loop until you've found your out(s).

Removing Enchantments & Non-Artifact Problem Permanents

When you have access to your draw loops you can use this to your advantage to allow for another important interaction.

Every deck runs Liquimetal Torque since it is a way to let you do Clock of Omens combo with Magda, Brazen Outlaw as your only dwarf on field and it just so happens to win through Grafdigger's Cage. Some decks also run Liquimetal Coating as well if they want more ways to have "artifact dwarves," which normally means turbo lists though less decklists even for turbo tend to be running it these days.

So instead of using Liquimetal Torque in order to combo off we're going to use it to remove that annoying Blind Obedience or whatever else your other interaction might not deal with.

The basic premise is simple, use Liquimetal Torque targeting the thing that is stopping your win to make it into an artifact. In most cases this is going to be an enchantment since our other interaction deals with creatures and artifacts. This however will allow us to use our shatters (artifact removal) to get rid of the thing you've just turned into an artifact with Liquimetal Torque.

This turns our shatter spells into catch all removal just like Spine of Ish Sah.

If you are under Blind Obedience like effects you'll have to use your infinite untapped treasures in conjunction with the ability of Clock of Omens to untap your Liquimetal Torque to enable this line of play.
Welding Away Your Own Null Rod - Goblin Welder & Goblin Engineer

This requires Goblin Welder or Goblin Engineer that has haste either from Cursed Mirror or Eriette's Tempting Apple. Normally this also requires tutoring Maskwood Nexus to enable the tutor for the Goblin Welder or Goblin Engineer

Once you have a goblin in play that can use it's ability make sure you have an artifact in the graveyard that can be traded for it if it is Goblin Welder otherwise Goblin Engineer puts one there for you.

If you need an artifact in yard for the welder variant then simply tutor any legendary artifact such as The One Ring and then tutor Sculpting Steel entering as a copy of the legendary artifact. Legend rule either to the graveyard.

Protecting Your Win

There are times your opponents may try to interact with you and normally the best time to do that is with magda's trigger on the stack when trying to combo off.

If you have the spare untapped artifacts or the treasures in order to use the ability of Magda, Brazen Outlaw to tutor more untapped artifacts to field you can protect yourself with Clock of Omens

The most simple way you can protect your win is by activating Magda, Brazen Outlaw again and continuing your combo on top of your own activation, or using that activation to help restart your combo. The only way this is not possible is with Trickbind or any other interaction with split second such as Sudden Shock

Otherwise you basically you can put as many Clock of Omens activations on the stack on top of their interaction attempt in order to allow you to still combo off over the top of this attempt at interacting. This is why interaction is essentially futile against a Magda that has infinite tapped treasures since they can just get extra untapped artifacts to allow them to restart their combo.

When an opponent interacts at the point where the Magda treasure trigger is on the stack which is before the initial resolution of the Clock of Omens activation that untaps your artifact dwarf you will have to get three untapped artifacts in order to attempt to restart your combo. This is because it takes one Clock of Omens activation to untap your artifact dwarf and then another untapped artifact to be used in conjunction with your artifact dwarf to restart your Clock of Omens combo. Interaction attempts are normally something people do to attempt to stop you on your first attempt to start your Clock Of Omens combo or they are silly and attempt it when you are trying to restart your combo after generating infinite tapped treasures and getting Roaming Throne or Maskwood Nexus and Xorn.

Some pilots are opting to use Battered Golem lines more often since as long as you have a non-zero board state there should be ways to force extra interaction. For every untapped dwarf you have when you start the line you have a second win attempt forcing another interaction attempt from your opponents which is a lot less of a requirement in many cases than the three artifacts you need for each interaction attempt when trying to combo off with Clock of Omens

Angel's Grace & The One Ring Protection

Angel's Grace is a card that lets an opponent attempt to save themselves from losing the game by preventing them from going below 1 life from taking damage.

The One Ring also causes opponents to gain protection from everything which can be quite annoying to deal with.

Fortunately there are a few ways we can cause loss of life which gets through this effect; God-Pharaoh's Statue and Eriette's Tempting Apple

Eriette's Tempting Apple cannot be used to win through The One Ring since you cannot target the opponent. However if an opponent tries to use Angel's Grace any loop that uses Eriette's Tempting Apple can take the opponent to zero life which when the turn ends Angel's Grace will fall off at a point in the cleanup step before state based actions would be checked such as player life total and the opponent will lose the game for being at 0 life at the first opportunity the game can check state based things.

The One Ring combo can only be done during our turn as it requires our end step to trigger God-Pharaoh's Statue to allow a combo with Dualcaster Mage and Return The Favor using the God-Pharaoh's Statue trigger during end step. If you want more information on this combo line check the Dualcaster Mage section.

Another way through Angel's Grace requires running equipment. If you are on something like Lightning Greaves you can have Cursed Mirror copy any creature and then attach Lightning Greaves to them. Then you will pass to end step. During cleanup the Cursed Mirror and Angel's Grace will both have their "until end of turn" aspects of the card complete at the same time which will cause the Lightning Greaves to unattach from the Cursed Mirror and force a new round of priority to happen allowing you to combo off at a time you normally cannot take game actions. This has been confirmed with a L5 Judge.

Thanks to Rust_ITG for getting all of this stuff straightened out and confirmed rules wise.

There are A LOT of ways you can go about winning the game with Magda, Brazen Outlaw

There are many packages of cards that work in conjunction with one another to allow you to win games in a variety of ways. Some catalysts are things such as Elixir of Immortality, Goblin Welder, Realm-Scorcher Hellkite, Eriette's Tempting Apple, Terror of the Peaks and Tel-Jilad Stylus

Win types include everything from life loss, damage to face at instant speed, combat damage and even potentially milling out our opponents.

Most of the deck variants only use a few card packages to secure wins while trying to have tools that allow wins through varying stax pieces. This is done by either having means of winning through problematic pieces or ways to remove what is stopping you being able to win.

One important thing to remember is that just because a line is easier to explain to your opponents does not make it any better or worth having over other potentially more complex lines that use pieces that are already in the deck for other reasons. This is especially true if a piece being added to your deck is only being added to further that goal of making your win easier to explain.

All combo lines will assume that Magda, Brazen Outlaw is on field and you're able to generate infinite treasures in some way.
Basic Outlets

These types of outlets tend to be avoided in many of the current iterations of Magda. The reason for this is that these types of outlets serve no real purpose outside of being a way to end the game and the only thing that these types of win conditions provide is simplicity and in a way help shortcut/shorten your line.

Some of the cards discussed can certainly have some secondary value but it's heavily dependent on the archetype you're looking to pilot.
Realm-Scorcher Hellkite & Skarrgan Hellkite

Realm-Scorcher Hellkite was essentially a strictly better version of Skarrgan Hellkite so its why Skarrgan is not seen much as they are actually essentially the same price. Sometimes Skarrgan gets played because it costs 1 less mana to play however it's ability costs more per activation.

Realm-Scorcher Hellkite and Skarrgan Hellkite both serve the exact same purpose in lists that run it. They acts as a way to end the game by dumping infinite mana into infinite activations of their abilities. After you have generated infinite untapped treasures for infinite mana you will do as follows;

    Tutor Realm-Scorcher Hellkite or Skarrgan Hellkite (Choose counter for RIOT so Skaargan can be activated)
    Activate Realm-Scorcher Hellkite or Skarrgan Hellkite to targeting an opponent with the ability.
    Hold priority and continue to put an infinite amount of activations on the stack while holding priority after each activation.
    Let all activations resolve and kill your opponents.

The reason you hold priority is that your your opponents cannot use anything to interact or prevent the win. This includes things with split second like Trickbind and V.A.T.S.

The downside to these lines however is that you cannot win by tutoring out creatures with a Grafdigger's Cage in play. You are required to find a way to remove it if you wish to use this type of wincon.

Grinding Station

This win-con is normally paired with Memory Jar which is a reason that a majority of the lists you might see do not run this as a win condition. If you don't have a way to make your opponents draw and end the game at instant speed while they have no library then you're forced to make your opponents draw in order to win which against some decks can be a risk. While decks like The Gitrog Monster are not common there are decks run multiple ways to shuffle their graveyard into their deck such as how Gitrog uses the "Shuffle Titans" as part of their own combo line protection.

This particular line is very simple;

Setup

    Generate infinite treasures.
    Tutor Grinding Station

Loop

    Tap Grinding Station to mill an opponent for 3.
    Restart any combo used to generate treasures causing a Magda, Brazen Outlaw trigger.
    Magda, Brazen Outlaw trigger resolves and untaps Grinding Station allowing you to tap it again.

Finish Variant 1

    Repeat loop until all opponents have 0 cards in library.
    Pass to opponents and let them lose one by one at their draw step.

Finish Variant 2 -Repeat loop until all opponents have 0 cards in library.

    Tutor Memory Jar
    Activate Memory Jar forcing opponents to draw.
    Opponents will lose the game when attempting to draw with no cards in their library.

ETB Loops/Outlets

The ETB loops listed here are specific to the creatures that use OTHER creatures entering to do damage. This means that other means of dealing damage through ETB effects such as Knight Paladin, Twinshot Sniper, Legion Extruder and Bogardan Hellkite are not discussed here.

Terror Of The Peaks & Scourge of Valkas are the two main outlets that will be discussed. Both of these creatures are similar because they rely on Maskwood Nexus in order to allow access to all creatures in your deck since most decks are not on many dragons.
Terror Of The Peaks

Terror of The Peaks is an interesting creature since it allows you to get the trigger from any creature ETBing. An important part of this is that it relies on the power of the creatures entering meaning that if anything modifies their power before the trigger resolves it will end up dealing more damage than the base power listed on the creature.

Because this combo requires Maskwood Nexus creatures that increase the power of your dwarves such as Magda, Brazen Outlaw, Adaptive Automaton, Metallic Mimic are incredibly potent in regards to helping you end the game with the least amount of tutors without reliance on being able to recur creatures that can sacrifice themselves like Dwarven Scorcher.

This also means that Dwarven Bloodboiler allows you to ETB creatures and tap themselves to it's ability in order to increase their power by 2.

Because the ETB effect is so important the ability to copy triggers or the Terror of the Peaks itself is very important. The introduction of Roaming Throne makes these lines a lot cleaner since even if you have it enter and choose dwarf earlier in the game to combo off to make your treasures when it is combined with Maskwood Nexus it allows you to multiply the triggers by the amount of Roaming Throne on field. So while we can turn Terror of The Peaks into an artifact and make a copy of it with things such as Sculpting Steel that same Sculpting Steel can be used on Roaming Throne to get the same effect of multiple triggers. This also lets the Roaming Throne + Xorn copy lines become a more potent way to transition into winning with Terror of The Peaks since you normally end up with three Roaming Throne in most cases which lets Terror of The Peaks trigger four times and lowers the amount of creatures that need to be tutored by a large margin.

One of the most important aspects of this combo line is that if you find yourself able to make infinite treasures through effects such as Null Rod or Stony Silence you can turn that into a win without needing to remove the piece that prevents artifacts from being activated.

With infinite treasures Magda, the Hoardmaster wins alone in conjunction with Terror of The Peaks

Because there are a few variants of this combo we're going to explain the different variants

We will assume you need to deal 120 damage to kill the table.

Variant 1: Dwarven Bloodboiler

Setup

    Generate infinite treasures (tapped or untapped does not matter)
    Tutor Maskwood Nexus, Roaming Throne (if not on field already) & Terror of The Peaks
    Tutor Adaptive Automaton choosing Dwarf and Dwarven Bloodboiler to field. Hold Priority with Terror of The Peaks trigger on the stack.
    Hold Priority on the Terror of The Peaks ETB Triggers.
    Tap Dwarven Bloodboiler to it's own ability giving it +2/0. Hold Priority.
    Tap Terror Of The Peaks to Dwarven Bloodboiler ability to give Dwarven Bloodboiler +2/0. Hold Priority.
    Tap Adaptive Automaton to Dwarven Bloodboiler ability to give Dwarven Bloodboiler +2/0,
    Resolve Terror Of The Peaks ETB triggers dealing 10 damage to any target twice. (+1/0 from Magda, +1/1 from Adaptive Automaton and +6/0 from two Bloodboiler activations) for Dwarven Bloodboiler ETB and 2 damage to any target from Adaptive Automaton ETB twice. Total 4 damage.

Finish

    Tutor your remaining creatures to field tapping them all to activate Dwarven Bloodboiler and give themselves +2/0.

This means every 1/1 turns into a 5/1 so each creature allows you to deal a minimum of 10 damage due to having a minimum of two Terror of The Peaks triggers per creature that enters. This requires 10 more creatures to ETB and go through the same process to win the game.

Variant 2: Three or More Triggers Per ETB

Setup

    Generate infinite treasures (tapped or untapped does not matter)
    Tutor Maskwood Nexus, Roaming Throne (if not on field already) & Terror of The Peaks
    Tutor two or more of the following to the field Sculpting Steel Mirror of the Forebears Cursed Mirror entering/becoming either Roaming Throne or Terror Of The Peaks. Hold priority on the Terror of The Peaks trigger between each tutor/copy.
    Resolve 9 total Terror of The Peaks ETB triggers (2 for first clone, 3 for second clone, 4 for third clone). Dealing 45 total damage.

Finish

    Tutor creature to field putting 5x Terror of The Peaks ETB triggers on the stack dealing a minimum of 10 total damage per creature that enters.

Magda buffs all creatures by +1/0 so 1/1s would deal 10 damage, 2/2s would deal 15 damage etc, This means a minimum of 7 creatures need to be tutored to win.

Variant 3: Combining Variant 1 and 2 - Most Damage Per ETB

    Generate infinite treasures (tapped or untapped does not matter)
    Tutor Maskwood Nexus, Roaming Throne (if not on field already) & Terror of The Peaks
    Tutor two or more of the following to the field Sculpting Steel Mirror of the Forebears Cursed Mirror entering/becoming either Roaming Throne or Terror Of The Peaks. Hold priority on the Terror of The Peaks trigger between each tutor/copy.
    Tutor Adaptive Automaton choosing Dwarf and Dwarven Bloodboiler to field. Hold Priority with Terror of The Peaks trigger on the stack.
    Tap Dwarven Bloodboiler to it's own ability giving it +2/0. Hold Priority.
    Tap Terror Of The Peaks to Dwarven Bloodboiler ability to give Dwarven Bloodboiler +2/0. Hold Priority.
    Tap Adaptive Automaton to Dwarven Bloodboiler ability to give Dwarven Bloodboiler +2/0, Hold Priority.
    Tap 4x Roaming Throne to Dwarven Bloodboiler ability to give Dwarven Bloodboiler +8/0. Hold Priority
    Resolve 5x Terror of The Peaks ETB trigger for Adaptive Automaton for 2 damage five times. 10 damage total.
    Resolve 5x Terror of The Peaks ETB trigger for Dwarven Bloodboiler for 18 damage five times. 90 damage total.
    Resolve 9 total Terror of The Peaks ETB triggers for Roaming Throne clones (2 for first clone, 3 for second clone, 4 for third clone). 45 damage total.

All opponents should be dead since you've dealt 145 damage. If for some reason an opponent is alive then tutor another creature to field and use Dwarven Bloodboiler to buff it and deal another 25 damage minimum per creature.

Variant 4: Maskwood Nexus & Clock Of Omens Only

The downside to this particular variant is that it cannot win through either Grafdigger's Cage or Null Rod type effects.

Setup

    Generate infinite treasures (tapped or untapped does not matter).
    Tutor Maskwood Nexus, Terror of The Peaks & Clock of Omens (if it is not on field).
    Use 3x Treasure to activate Maskwood Nexus generating a 2/2 Shapeshifter.
    Resolve Terror of the Peaks dealing 3 damage to any target.
    Activate Clock of Omens targeting Maskwood Nexus by using 2x Treasure to untap Maskwood Nexus untapping it.

Loop

    Use 3x Treasure to activate Maskwood Nexus generating a 2/2 Shapeshifter.
    Resolve Terror of the Peaks dealing 3 damage to any target.
    Activate Clock of Omens targeting Maskwood Nexus by using 2x Treasure to untap Maskwood Nexus untapping it.

Scourge of Valkas

Scourge Of Valkas is a similar win condition to Terror of The Peaks as they both rely on Maskwood Nexus in order to tutor every creature in your deck.

Scourge of Valkas however deals damage equal to the amount of dragons currently on the battlefield rather than based on the creature's power that is entering.

This makes Scourge of Valkas quite a bit simpler to end games with since the line is a bit more streamlined requiring less math when done optimally.

We will assume you need to deal 120 damage to kill the table.

Variant 1: No Extra Triggers

Setup

    Generate infinite treasures (tapped or untapped does not matter)
    Tutor Maskwood Nexus & Scourge of Valkas
    Tutor any creature to field. Deal a minimum of 3 damage to any target (Magda, Valkas, New Creature)
    Tutor any creature to field. Deal a minimum of 4 damage to any target.

Finish

    Tutor every creature in your deck to field. You must tutor at least 15 creatures to field to kill your opponents if you only need to deal 120 damage.

Variant 2: Extra Triggers

Setup

    Generate infinite treasures (tapped or untapped does not matter)
    Tutor Maskwood Nexus & Scourge of Valkas
    Tutor Roaming Throne . Deal a minimum of 3 damage to any target (Magda, Valkas, New Creature)
    Tutor Sculpting Steel as a copy of Roaming Throne. Deal 8 damage to any target.
    Tutor Cursed Mirror as a copy of Roaming Throne or Scourge Of Vaalkas. Deal 15 damage to any target.
    Tutor any creature to field. Deal 24 damage to any target.

Finish

    Tutor as many creatures as necessary to kill your opponents.

With this setup it should take 3 or less tutors if your opponents' life in total is equal to 120.

Variant 3: Maskwood Nexus + Clock Of Omens Only

The downside to this particular variant is that it cannot win through either Grafdigger's Cage or Null Rod type effects.

Setup

    Generate infinite treasures (tapped or untapped does not matter).
    Tutor Maskwood Nexus, Scourge Of Valkas & Clock of Omens (if it is not on field).
    Use 3x Treasure to activate Maskwood Nexus generating a 2/2 Shapeshifter.
    Resolve Scourge Of Valkas dealing 3 damage to any target.
    Activate Clock of Omens targeting Maskwood Nexus by using 2x Treasure to untap Maskwood Nexus untapping it.

Loop

    Use 3x Treasure to activate Maskwood Nexus generating a 2/2 Shapeshifter.
    Resolve Scourge Of Valkas dealing X damage to any target where X is equal to the amount of creatures on the battlefield.
    Activate Clock of Omens targeting Maskwood Nexus by using 2x Treasure to untap Maskwood Nexus untapping it.

Elixir Of Immortality Outlets

Elixir of Immortality is a potent engine for ending the game at instant speed since not only it's ability is able to be done at any time you have priority but so is the ability to tutor with Magda, Brazen Outlaw. This allows cards that go to the graveyard to be put back into your deck and be tutored by Magda, Brazen Outlaw again enabling some interesting loops.
Eriette's Tempting Apple & Pyrite Spellbomb

These outlets are artifacts and because of this win lines that use Elixir of Immortality as a catalyst to generating infinite treasures through Grafdigger's Cage can then be transitioned into wins as neither Eriette's Tempting Apple or Pyrite Spellbomb are creatures and when interacting with the graveyard you are shuffling them back into your library and not casting them.

Eriette's Tempting Apple is an artifact that has an ability where you can pay and and sacrifice it in order to cause an opponent to lose 3 life.

Pyrite Spellbomb is an artifact that has an ability where you can pay and sacrifice it to deal 2 damage to any target.

Because both of these artifacts end up in the graveyard after using their abilities Elixir of Immortality can then be used to place itself and either Eriette's Tempting Apple or Pyrite Spellbomb back into your library to be tutored once more with our commander.

Setup

    Make Infinite Untapped Treasures which can be used for infinite mana of any color.
    Tutor Eriette's Tempting Apple or Pyrite Spellbomb & Elixir of Immortality

Loop

    Pay Either or to activate either Eriette's Tempting Apple or Pyrite Spellbomb causing it to be sacrificed and go to the graveyard.
    Resolve the ability to cause an opponent to lose 3 life or take 2 damage depending on artifact used.
    Activate Elixir of Immortality shuffling your graveyard and itself into your library.
    Retutor Eriette's Tempting Apple or Pyrite Spellbomb & Elixir of Immortality

Repeat this loop until all opponents have been eliminated.

Maskwood Nexus + Elixir - Terror Of The Peaks & Scourge of Valkas

Because this is a creature based combo that uses activations of artifacts it cannot win through either Grafdigger's Cage or Null Rod effects.

Both Terror of The Peaks and Scourge of Valkas have interactions with Elixir of Immortality due to Maskwood Nexus making every creature into a dragon.

This lets you use creatures that can be sacrificed such as Dwarven Scorcher Enslaved Dwarf and Liberated Dwarf in combination with Elixir of Immortality to have infinite amounts of creature ETBs if you are somehow forced to win without Clock of Omens and cannot simply generate infinite 2/2 Shapeshifters by constantly activating Maskwood Nexus and untapping it with Clock of Omens.

Setup

    Make infinite treasures
    Tutor Maskwood Nexus if not on field and either Terror of The Peaks or Scourge of Valkas
    Tutor any creature with a sacrifice ability to field. Dwarven Scorcher can be done with tapped treasure lines where as Enslaved Dwarf Liberated Dwarf require untapped treasure due to having a sacrifice cost of
    ETB triggers Terror of The Peaks or Scourge of Valkas

Loop

    Sacrifice your loopable creature such as Dwarven Scorcher to put it in the graveyard.
    Tutor Elixir of Immortality & Activate it.
    Resolve Elixir of Immortality and shuffle your loopable creature and Elixir of Immortality into your library
    Tutor your loopable creature & Elixir Of Immortality
    ETB triggers Terror of The Peaks or Scourge of Valkas

Repeat loop until all opponents are eliminated.
Elixir Of Immortality Draw > Damage Loops

We have many ways to deal damage that are loopable when combined with any means of infinitely drawing and Elixir of Immortality to be able to force them back into your library to be re-drawn and replayed.

Primarily these are going to be spells such as Lightning Bolt, Galvanic Blast or any other instant that will deal damage to any target. The problem however with these cards for ending some lines is that if an opponent has a means of forcing one spell per turn such as Rule of Law then you cannot win with them. The only way around this is by using Twinshot Sniper and it's channel ability since abilities are not considered spells and can still be done an infinite amount of times per turn unless someone happens to have Trickbind.

You can do the loop using any means of drawing your deck that requires going to the graveyard in some way such as Pyrite Spellbomb//Stone of Erech//Soul-Guide Lantern or The One Ring & Sculpting Steel.

The One Ring + Sculpting Steel

Setup

    Perform Elixir of Immortality + The One Ring + Sculpting Steel loop outlined in the section above until you have drawn your entire deck leaving Elixir of Immortality and The One Ring on field.

If necessary do an extra loop without drawing to replace Sculpting Steel with The One Ring to generate this board state. This is unnecessary if you understand the loop but it will be used here to set a defined loop.

Loop

    Cast Lightning Bolt or channel Twinshot Sniper
    Activate Elixir of Immortality shuffling itself, Sculpting Steel and Lightning Bolt//Twinshot Sniper back into your library
    Tutor Elixir of immortality & Sculpting Steel entering as a copy of The One Ring. Legend rule sacrificing the original copy to the graveyard.
    Tap Sculpting Steel to draw Lightning Bolt or Twinshot Sniper
    Cast Lightning Bolt or channel Twinshot Sniper
    Activate Elixir of Immortality shuffling itself, The One Ring and Lightning Bolt//Twinshot Sniper back into your library
    Tutor Elixir of Immortality & The One Ring. Legend rule sacrificing the Sculpting Steel] copy to the graveyard.
    Tap The One Ring to draw Lightning Bolt or Twinshot Sniper

Repeat until all opponents are eliminated.

Pyrite Spellbomb//Stone of Erech//Soul-Guide Lantern

For this variant we will be using Pyrite Spellbomb even though both Stone of Erech and Soul-Guide Lantern function identically.

Setup

    Perform Elixir of Immortality + Pyrite Spellbomb draw loop outlined in the above section until you have drawn your entire deck leaving Elixir of Immortality and Pyrite Spellbomb on the battlefield.
    Cast Lightning bolt or channel Twinshot Sniper
    Activate Elixir of Immortality to shuffle itself and Lightning Bolt or Twinshot Sniper into your library.
    Tutor Elixir of Immortality
    Activate Pyrite Spellbomb to draw Lightning Bolt or Twinshot Sniper
    Cast Lightning bolt or channel Twinshot Sniper

Loop

    Activate Elixir of Immortality to shuffle itself, Pyrite Spellbomb and Lightning Bolt or Twinshot Sniper into your library.
    Tutor Elixir of Immortality & Pyrite Spellbomb
    Activate Pyrite Spellbomb to draw Lightning Bolt or Twinshot Sniper
    Cast Lightning bolt or channel Twinshot Sniper

Repeat until all opponents are eliminated.

Tel-Jilad Stylus Outlets

All stylus outlets are contingent on using Clock of Omens as a way to continually untap your Tel-Jilad Stylus to put whatever it is you are comboing off with back into your deck.

It also requires infinite untapped treasures since you are reliant on Clock of Omens and due to this reliance you cannot do these lines through Nullrod type effects.
Twinshot Sniper //Terror Of The Peaks//Scourge of Valkas//Bogardan Hellkite - Creature Based Lines

The thing all of these have in common is that they require creatures to function.

This means that not only do these lines not work through Null Rod Effects but they don't work through Grafdigger's Cage either.

All of these creatures have something in common as well is that they all have ETB effects, either their own ETB effect in Twinshot Sniper and Bogardan Hellkite or when another creature enters the battlefield for Terror of The Peaks and Scourge of Valkas

Twinshot Sniper//Bogardan Hellkite Variant

Setup

    Obtain infinite untapped treasures
    Tutor Tel-Jilad Stylyus and Clock of Omens (if it is not on field already)

Loop

    Tutor Twinshot sniper or Bogardan Hellkite and resolve their ETB dealing damage to any target.
    Activate Tel-Jilad Stylus putting Twinshot Sniper or Bogardan Hellkite back into your library.
    Tap two Treasure to activate Clock of Omens targeting Tel-Jilad Stylus
    Resolve Clock of Omens untapping Tel-Jilad Stylus

Repeat loop until all opponents are eliminated.

Terror of the Peaks//Scourge of Valkas

Setup

    Obtain infinite untapped treasures
    Tutor Tel-Jilad Stylyus and Clock of Omens (if it is not on field already)
    Tutor Maskwood Nexus and Terror Of The Peaks or Scourge of Valkas

Loop

    Tutor any other creature and resolve the Terror of The Peaks//Scourge of Valkas ETB dealing damage to any target.
    Activate Tel-Jilad Stylus putting the creature you chose back into your deck.
    Tap two Treasure to activate Clock of Omens targeting Tel-Jilad Stylus
    Resolve Clock of Omens untapping Tel-Jilad Stylus

Repeat loop until all opponents are eliminated.

Spine of Ish Sah//Legion Extruder//Knight Paladin - Artifact Based Lines

Legion Extruder//Knight Paladin

The Legion Extruder//Knight Paladin line works exactly the same as the Twinshot Sniper//Bogardan Hellkite line outlined in the previous section however it does win through Grafdigger's Cage unlike the creature variants.

Since both Legion Extruder and Knight Paladin function exactly the same we are going to use Legion Extruder for our example.

Setup

    Obtain infinite untapped treasures
    Tutor Tel-Jilad Stylyus and Clock of Omens (if it is not on field already)

Loop

    Tutor Legion Extruder and resolve their ETB dealing damage to any target.
    Activate Tel-Jilad Stylus putting Legion Extruder back in your library.
    Tap two Treasure to activate Clock of Omens targeting Tel-Jilad Stylus
    Resolve Clock of Omens untapping Tel-Jilad Stylus

Repeat loop until all opponents are eliminated.

Spine of Ish Sah

Spine of Ish Sah when looped for repeated ETBs makes it so your opponents are left with no permanents with every permanent you have in your deck on field.

This line works through both Null Rod type effects and Grafdigger's Cage due to the fact that not only is it an artifact which means allows you to play around Grafdigger's Cage but it allows you to have Null Rod or any similar effect be the first target when it's tutored so the only thing that stops you would be things like Elesh Norn, Mother Of Machines and Doorkeeper Thrull.

That being said if you wish to play through those Null Rod style effects you have to generate infinite untapped treasures in a way without Clock of Omens.

This line is not normally used unless you specifically do not have an instant speed win available to you at the time, though if your opponents don't concede with no permanents they are masochists.

Setup

    Obtain infinite untapped treasures
    Tutor Tel-Jilad Stylyus and Clock of Omens (if it is not on field already)
    Tutor Spine of Ish Sah targeting any permanent an opponent controls to destroy it. Null Rod type effects are your first target.

Loop

    Activate Tel-Jilad Stylus putting Spine of Ish Sah back in your library.
    Tap two Treasure to activate Clock of Omens targeting Tel-Jilad Stylus
    Resolve Clock of Omens untapping Tel-Jilad Stylus
    Tutor Spine of Ish Sah targeting any permananent an opponent controls to destroy it.

Loop until all permanents of opponents are destroyed. Then proceed to tutor your entire deck and win during the following turn cycle.

Stylus The One Ring Draw Loop

This line is here for if your deck is not on Spine of Ish Sah as a way to remove Grafdigger's Cage and enable your creature based ETB wins. Though why a Stylus list would not be on Spine boggles my mind.

Since Stylus is so underplayed I felt this draw loop was better suited to be put here instead of in the section about combo adjacent information.

Setup

    Obtain infinite untapped treasures
    Tutor Tel-Jilad Stylyus, The One Ring and Clock of Omens (if it is not on field already)

Loop

    Tap The One Ring to draw a card
    Tap Tel-Jilad Stylus targeting The One ring
    Tap two Treasure to activate Clock of Omens targeting Tel-Jilad Stylus
    Resolve Clock of Omens untapping Tel-Jilad Stylus
    Tutor The One Ring

Finish

    Find the shatter you need to remove Grafdigger's Cage and then do the Twinshot Sniper loop listed in the above section.

Maskwood Nexus & Magda, the Hoardmaster - Combat Damage Wins

Since Maskwood Nexus is used in many other win conditions its important to understand the difference between using it as a wincon itself and using it to enable another line such as the damage based ETB lines for Terror of the Peaks and Scourge of Valkas

The main difference between Maskwood Nexus and Magda, The Hoardmaster is that Magda can only generate the creatures you're going to use to win on your own turn. The upside however is that you don't have to jump through any hoops to give those creatures haste like you do for the Maskwood Nexus line.

Magda, The Hoardmaster

This line does not win through Grafdigger's Cage but does squeak through Null Rod type effects.

Setup

    Obtain infinite treasures
    Tutor Maskwood Nexus
    Tutor Magda, The Hoardmaster now that it is considered a dragon.

Loop

During Main Phase 1

    Activate Magda, The Hoardmaster
    Hold Priority on the activation

Continue loop until you have pseudo infinite Scorpion Dragon on the stack and then let everything resolve. The reason you hold priority is that so your opponents cannot interact and stop your win even with something like Trickbind

Maskwood Nexus

This line specifically requires Axgard Cavalry as it allows you to give the tokens that Maskwood Nexus generates haste.

Setup

    Obtain infinite untapped treasures.
    Tutor Maskwood Nexus & Clock of Omens (if not on field)
    Tutor Axgard Cavalry
    Tutor Liquimetal Torque or Mirror of the Forebears naming Dwarf
    Activate Mirror of the Forebears to become Axgard Cavalry or Tutor Cursed Mirror, enter as a copy of artifact Axgard Cavalry and use Liquimetal Torque to make the Cursed Mirror copy into an artifact.

Loop

    Activate Maskwood Nexus generating a 2/2 Shapeshifter
    Tap Cursed Mirror copy of Axgard Cavalry to give the 2/2 Shapeshifter haste.
    Tap two Treasure to Activate Clock of Omens targeting Maskwood Nexus to untap it.
    Tap two Treasure to Activate Clock of Omens targeting Cursed Mirror copy of Axgard Cavalry to untap it.

Continue until you have infinite hastey creatures and attack for the win.

Engineer & Welder Loops (Damage & Destruction)

Goblin Welder and Goblin Engineer both allow you to win with infinite ETBs. It functions in the same manner as Tel-Jilad Stylus essentially allowing you to win with the same sort of permanents.

Similarly it requires Clock of Omens and being made into an artifact to function for all loop variants other than Eriette's Tempting Apple.

The different win conditions consist of; Eriette's Tempting Apple, Twinshot Sniper, Legion Extruder, Terror of The Peaks, Scourge of Valkas and Spine of Ish Sah
Eriette's Tempting Apple

This line assumes you are not on Elixir of Immortality but are on Maskwood Nexus and Goblin Welder.

Goblin Engineer does not work since Eriette's Tempting Apple is legendary and if you try to circumvent this with Sculpting Steel it will not work since you cannot activate it's ability in response to the legend rule as it is a state based action.

Setup

    Obtain infinite treasures.
    Tutor Maskwood Nexus
    Tutor Goblin Welder
    Tutor Eriette's Tempting Apple ETB targeting Goblin Welder to give it haste.

Loop

    Activate and sacrifice Eriette's Tempting Apple causing an opponent to lose 3 life.
    Activate Goblin Welder with Treasure & Eriette's Tempting Apple as targets.
    Eriette's Tempting Apple ETB targeting Goblin Welder to untap it.

Twinshot Sniper//Legion Extruder

Both of these function in the same way.

We'll be using Twinshot Sniper for these examples

So for anything in this section just replace Twinshot Sniper with Legion Extruder. The major difference however is that if you already have Goblin Welder or Goblin Engineer on field the extruder line works through Grafdigger's Cage

Goblin Welder

Setup

    Obtain infinite untapped treasures.
    Tutor Maskwood Nexus & Clock of Omens (if not on field already).
    Tutor Goblin Welder
    Tutor Liquimetal Torque or Mirror of the Forebears naming goblin (or dwarf if you have maskwood out).
    Activate Mirror of the Forebears to become Goblin Welder or Tutor Cursed Mirror, enter as a copy of artifact Goblin Welder and use Liquimetal Torque to make the Cursed Mirror copy into an artifact.
    Tutor Twinshot Sniper ETB deal 2 damage to any target.
    Tutor any artifact that can remove itself from play; Spine of Ish Sah, Lotus Petal, Jeweled Lotus or Sculpting Steel
    Activate Lotus Petal//Jeweled Lotus to add mana and put it in the graveyard. Alternatively resolve the fist half of the Spine of Ish Sah ETB targeting itself putting it in the graveyard, hold priority on the trigger to put it to hand.

Loop (Lotus Petal//Jeweled Lotus Version)

    Activate Cursed Mirror copy of Goblin Welder targeting Twinshot Sniper and Lotus Petal
    Tap 2x Treasure to activate Clock of Omens targeting Cursed Mirror copy of Goblin Welder to untap it.
    Activate Cursed Mirror copy of Goblin Welder targeting Twinshot Sniper and Lotus Petal
    Twinshot Sniper ETB deal 2 damage to any target.
    Tap 2x Treasure to activate Clock of Omens targeting Cursed Mirror copy of Goblin Welder to untap it.

Repeat until all opponents are eliminated

Loop (Spine of Ish Sah)

    Activate Cursed Mirror copy of Goblin Welder targeting Twinshot Sniper and Spine of Ish Sah
    Spine of Ish Sah ETB targeting itself. Hold Priority.
    Tap 2x Treasure to activate Clock of Omens targeting Cursed Mirror copy of Goblin Welder to untap it.
    Activate Cursed Mirror copy of Goblin Welder targeting Spine of Ish Sah and Twinshot Sniper
    ResolveTwinshot Sniper ETB deal 2 damage to any target. Hold priority on Spine of Ish Sah LTB trigger. Since these happen simultaneously you can layer the stack how you wish.
    Tap 2x Treasure to activate Clock of Omens targeting Cursed Mirror copy of Goblin Welder to untap it.

Goblin Engineer

Setup

    Obtain infinite untapped treasures.

    Tutor Goblin Engineer ETB put any CMC 3 or less artifact in graveyard. (We'll use Jeweled Lotus in our example here)
    Tutor Liquimetal Torque or Mirror of the Forebears naming goblin (or dwarf if you have maskwood out).

    Tutor Twinshot Sniper ETB deal 2 damage to any target.
    Tutor Sculpting Steel as a copy of Twinshot Sniper ETB deal 2 damage to any target.

Loop

    Activate Cursed Mirror copy of Goblin Engineer targeting Jeweled Lotus and Sculpting Steel.

    Activate Cursed Mirror copy of Goblin Engineer targeting Sculpting Steel and Jeweled Lotus.
    Sculpting Steel enters as a copy of Twinshot Sniper ETB 2 damage to any target.
    Tap 2x Treasure to activate Clock of Omens targeting Cursed Mirror copy of Goblin Welder to untap it.

Spine of Ish Sah

For this version you can use either Goblin Welder or Goblin Engineer, the only difference is that you can skip a tutor step by putting something 3CMC or less into the GY and using that instead of the listed Lotus Petal//Jeweled Lotus when using engineer.

The reason both variants function exactly the same way is because sculpting steel streamlines things a bit more easily though for a welder specific variant you can skip the Sculpting Steel and just use the Lotus Petal//Jeweled Lotus and the Spine of Ish Sah, just be careful when spine LTB goes on the stack.

Welder Variant

Setup

    Obtain infinite untapped treasures.
    Tutor Maskwood Nexus & Clock of Omens (if not on field already).
    Tutor Goblin Welder
    Tutor Liquimetal Torque or Mirror of the Forebears naming goblin (or dwarf if you have maskwood out).
    Activate Mirror of the Forebears to become Goblin Welder or Tutor Cursed Mirror, enter as a copy of artifact Goblin Welder and use Liquimetal Torque to make the Cursed Mirror copy into an artifact.
    Tutor any artifact that can remove itself from play; Such as [Lotus Petal, Jeweled Lotus
    Tutor Spine of Ish Sah ETB targeting an opponent's permanent.
    Tutor Sculpting Steel as a copy of Spine of Ish Sah ETB targeting an opponent's permanent. (This step is unnecessary if using welder, you can just use the original spine to go in and out)
    Activate Lotus Petal//Jeweled Lotus to add mana and put it in the graveyard.

Loop

    Activate Cursed Mirror copy of Goblin Welder targeting Jeweled Lotus and Sculpting Steel.
    Hold priority on Sculpting Steel copy of Spine of Ish Sah LTB.
    Tap 2x Treasure to activate Clock of Omens targeting Cursed Mirror copy of Goblin Welder to untap it.
    Activate Cursed Mirror copy of Goblin Welder targeting Sculpting Steel and Jeweled Lotus.
    Sculpting Steel enters as a copy of Spine of Ish Sah ETB targeting an opponent's permanent.
    Tap 2x Treasure to activate Clock of Omens targeting Cursed Mirror copy of Goblin Welder to untap it.

Loop until all permanents of opponents are destroyed. Then proceed to tutor your entire deck and win during the following turn cycle.

If using Spine of Ish Sah instead of Sculpting Steel for the welder variant just follow the same steps but replace Sculpting Steel with Spine of Ish Sah

Video below showcases NOT using Sculpting Steel for the welder variant, just Spine of Ish Sah

Engineer Variant

Setup

    Obtain infinite untapped treasures.
    Tutor Maskwood Nexus & Clock of Omens (if not on field already).
    Tutor Goblin Engineer ETB put any CMC 3 or less artifact in graveyard. (We'll use Jeweled Lotus in our example here)

    Sculpting Steel enters as a copy of Spine Of Ish Sah targeting any permanent your opponent controls.
    Tap 2x Treasure to activate Clock of Omens targeting Cursed Mirror copy of Goblin Engineer to untap it.

Terror Of The Peaks & Scourge of Valkas

For this version you can use either Goblin Welder or Goblin Engineer, the only difference is that you can skip a tutor step by putting something 3CMC or less into the GY and using that instead of the listed Lotus Petal//Jeweled Lotus when using engineer. All artifact creatures we run really other than Roaming Throne are 3cmc or less so they can all be chosen by engineer.

While this variant does exist its likely unnecessary since the baseline variant is "stronger" but its nice to have options.

Setup

    Obtain infinite untapped treasures.
    Tutor Maskwood Nexus & Clock of Omens (if not on field already).
    Tutor Goblin Welder
    Tutor Liquimetal Torque or Mirror of the Forebears naming goblin (or dwarf if you have maskwood out).
    Activate Mirror of the Forebears to become Goblin Welder or Tutor Cursed Mirror, enter as a copy of artifact Goblin Welder and use Liquimetal Torque to make the Cursed Mirror copy into an artifact.
    Tutor any artifact that can remove itself from play; Such as Lotus Petal, Jeweled Lotus
    Activate Lotus Petal//Jeweled Lotus to add mana and put it in the graveyard.
    Tutor Terror of The Peaks or Scourge of Valkas (Both cause ETB damage and all creatures that enter will be dragons since Maskwood Nexus is in play).

Loop

    Activate Cursed Mirror copy of Goblin Welder targeting Jeweled Lotus and Universal Automaton (Artifact Creature).
    Tap 2x Treasure to activate Clock of Omens targeting Cursed Mirror copy of Goblin Welder to untap it.

    Tap 2x Treasure to activate Clock of Omens targeting Cursed Mirror copy of Goblin Welder to untap it.

MDFC Variant - Pinnacle Monk//Mystic Peak

Goblin Engineer and Goblin Welder both work for this line as the thing you are swapping in and out is only 3 cmc, Sculpting Steel

Setup

    Obtain infinite untapped treasures.
    Tutor Maskwood Nexus & Clock of Omens (if not on field already).
    Tutor Goblin Welder
    Tutor Liquimetal Torque or Mirror of the Forebears naming goblin (or dwarf if you have maskwood out).
    Activate Mirror of the Forebears to become Goblin Welder or Tutor Cursed Mirror, enter as a copy of artifact Goblin Welder and use Liquimetal Torque to make the Cursed Mirror copy into an artifact.
    Tutor any artifact that can remove itself from play; Such as Lotus Petal, Jeweled Lotus
    Activate Lotus Petal//Jeweled Lotus to add mana and put it in the graveyard.

    Tutor Liquimetal Torque if not on field or Activate Clock of Omens using two Treasure untapping Liquimetal Torque
    Activate Liquimetal Torque targeting Pinnacle Monk // Mystic Peak
    Cast and resolve a burn spell such as Lightning Bolt
    Tutor Sculpting Steel entering as a copy of Pinnacle Monk // Mystic Peak ETB putting Lightning Bolt to hand.

Loop

    Cast and resolve a burn spell such as Lightning Bolt holding priority.
    Activate Cursed Mirror copy of Goblin Welder targeting Jeweled Lotus and Sculpting Steel
    Tap 2x Treasure to activate Clock of Omens targeting Cursed Mirror copy of Goblin Welder to untap it.

    Sculpting Steel entering as a copy of Pinnacle Monk // Mystic Peak ETB putting Lightning Bolt to hand.
    Tap 2x Treasure to activate Clock of Omens targeting Cursed Mirror copy of Goblin Welder to untap it.

Dualcaster Mage

We all know the basic line of using a copy spell like Twinflame//Heat Shimmer//Molten Duplication on one of your creatures, holding priority and casting Dualcaster Mage however Magda can make for some really interesting lines with dualcaster especially in conjunction with the new card Return The Favor.

Lines courtesy of Rust_ITG
Dualcaster + Roaming Throne +Copy Spell + Bolt

Setup

    Tutor Roaming Throne naming Human (or anything if you have Maskwood Nexus out).
    Cast a Copy Spell (Twinflame//Heat Shimmer//Molten Duplication) targeting any of your creatures.
    Hold Priority and cast Lightning Bolt holding priority again.
    Cast or tutor out Dualcaster Mage

Loop

    Dualcaster Mage ETB happens twice because of Roaming Throne. Target both the Copy Spell and Lightning Bolt
    Resolve Lightning Bolt copy dealing 3 damage to an opponent
    Resolve Copy of the Copy Spell targeting Dualcaster Mage

Dualcaster Mage + Roaming Throne + Bolt + Zoyowa's Justice

    Obtain Infinite Treasures
    Tutor Roaming Throne and Maskwood Nexus and any stax that will not let opponent's interact easily.
    Draw Loop of your choice until you have Lightning Bolt and Zoyowa's Justice
    Cast a Copy Spell Zoyowa's Justice targeting any of your creatures.
    Hold Priority and cast Lightning Bolt holding priority again.
    Cast or tutor out Dualcaster Mage if he is still in your deck.

Loop

    Dualcaster Mage ETB happens twice because of Roaming Throne. Target both the Zoyowa's Justice and Lightning Bolt
    Resolve Lightning Bolt copy dealing 3 damage to an opponent
    Resolve Zoyowa's Justice putting Dualcaster Mage in your library. Discover 3.
    Tutor Dualcaster Mage if Discover does not hit DCM otherwise re-cast DCM with the Discover from Zoyowa's Justice resolution.

As long as you have things in your deck that are >3 cmc still in there then you're able to do this loop no problem entirely deterministically.

If you want extra safety then use Cursed Mirror in addition to Dualcaster Mage by leaving DCM on field and having Cursed Mirror enter as a copy of him. Zoyowa's Justice works on artifacts and creatures as so as long as Cursed Mirror is not in your graveyard or exiled then this makes the line much safer.

This line can also be done by tutoring to a specific integer that The One Ring can draw out of your deck to put you at 0 cards. This way when your copy of Zoyowa's Justice resolves it will always discover into DCM which lets you finish the loop. This works with limited untapped treasures and no Maskwood Nexus

Dualcaster + Sculpting Steel + Welder/Engineer - Burn & Life Loss Variants

Goblin Engineer and Goblin Welder both work for this line as the thing you are swapping in and out is only 3 cmc, Sculpting Steel

The life loss variant wins through the protection caused by the casting of The One Ring. You cannot target an opponent to cause loss of life however the end step trigger from God Pharaoh's Statue does not target and can still cause life loss through the protection.

    Cast Return The Favor with the mode that lets you copy a triggered ability targeting the God-Pharaoh's Statue trigger.
    Tutor Sculpting Steel entering as a copy of Dualcaster Mage ETB copying Return The Favor with the mode that lets you copy a triggered ability targeting the God-Pharaoh's Statue trigger causing 1 loss of life to all opponents.

    Activate Eriette's Tempting Apple sacrificing it and draining an opponent for 3.

Dualcaster Mage//Pinnacle Monk + Roaming Throne + Zoyowa's Justice//Chaos Warp + Bolt Effect (Sans Maskwood)

This line wins through Grafdigger's Cage and wins at instant speed with Dualcaster Mage, or on your own turn with Pinnacle Monk // Mystic Peak. The Pinnacle Monk // Mystic Peak variant is normally unnecessary since instead of doing this you can just draw loop into Magda, The Hoardmaster and win through combat instead, but the line does exist.

Make sure drannith is killed before you resolve any copy of Zoyowa's Justice as it stops this combo, or anything else that prevents things from being cast from exile. Chaos Warp dodges this requirement.

Staple Cards & Pseudo Staples

These lists were agreed upon by a few notable pilots in the Open Hands CEDH community. There is ALWAYS room for interpretation and these types of things will almost always be opinion based so take it with a grain of salt.
Staples

Creatures

    Dockside Extortionist - This card needs no explanation, treasures = good.
    Magda, The Hoardmaster - Treasure generator for doing what some variants of the deck do best… interact and target things to do so. Infinite treasure outlet that also functions as a way to just get an army of beaters over time for stax variants.
    Plundering Barbarian - Mono-Red Reclamation Sage, our only way to force remove Null Rod if not on Spine of Ish Sah. This card also happens to be modal with the other option giving us acceleration.
    Professional Face-Breaker - Not only does this let us get value from attacking into board states where we can but it acts as a way to get a draw loop through Null Rod
    Roaming Throne - Doubles Magda Triggers which bridges the gap easily between tapped and untapped treasures for our Clock of Omens loop. Also happens to be an artifact dwarf so its a 1 card combo with Clock of Omens
    Universal Automaton - 1 drop artifact dwarf.

Spells

    Abrade - Modal artifact or creature removal for most of the things that stop us outside of some things with higher toughness such as Yasharn, Implacable Earth and Linvala, Keeper of Silence
    Bottle-Cap Blast - Interaction and treasure generator that lets us use our spare artifacts to help pay for the cost.
    Deflecting Swat - One of the few ways we can protect our commander when targeted and is great stack interaction.
    Galvanic Blast - 4 damage just for having three artifacts which is more often than not.
    Lightning Bolt - 3 damage red for 1… Red’s staple burn card since forever.
    Return The Favor - The floor for this card is copying a card draw or treasure trigger and the ceiling is winning the game. It's a 3 cost fork, way to tutor with an opponent’s Ranger-Captain Of Eos or one of the stronger options in being a way to get a second Magda activation.

Artifacts

    Clock of Omens - Our most notable combo line.
    Clown Car - 0 drop vehicle that can provide creatures in mid game that may be dwarves when Maskwood Nexus is on field.
    Cursed Mirror - THE copy creature artifact. Lets you copy an opponent’s Dockside Exortionist or any other creature of your choice. It is also a means of giving haste to creatures we use to combo off such as Goblin Welder. Very important part of some of the copy lines with Roaming Throne and Xorn
    God-Pharaoh's Statue - Asymmetrical stax piece that makes a lot of lines harder or impossible for many decks.
    High-Speed Hoverbike//Smuggler's Copter - 2 drop vehicles that either give us the ability to loot or can act as a means of generating surprise treasures or stopping that pesky 20/20 orc from swinging at your face.
    Liquimetal Torque - Mana rock that lets us make any dwarf into an artifact or any non-land permanent an opponent controls into an artifact to be destroyed. Also acts as a way to potentially combo through Grafdigger's Cage
    Mana Crypt
    Mox Opal - We are almost always generating enough treasures for this to be on and with most lists being between 25 and 35 artifacts our main gameplan tends to turn this on baseline.
    Portal To Phyrexia - Many decks don’t flood the board with creatures so this lets you remove important pieces from your opponent’s board state while giving you the ability to reanimate something every turn with access to all player’s graveyards.
    Sculpting Steel - Combo piece and just a strong clone effect that lets us copy anything.
    Sol Ring
    SpringLeaf Drum - Mana acceleration that lets us tap dwarves to generate treasure.
    The One Ring - Draw engine that can also act as a combo engine.
    Unlicensed Hearse - Graveyard hate is something we’re light on, this also acts as a combo piece in some specific lines. It can also force blocks from opponents as if you use its ability a few times you’re able to swing with a 6/6 which is a decent clock.

Land

    Ancient Tomb - Life as a resource for mana acceleration.
    Cavern of Souls - Uncounterable dwarves.
    Holdout Settlement - Way to generate treasures without a vehicle.
    Mutavault - Dwarf body on a land.
    Survivors' Encampment - Way to generate treasures without a vehicle.
    Treasure Vault - Turn extra mana into treasures.
    Urza's Saga - Go get your Universal Automaton. Sol Ring, Mana Crypt, Grafdigger’s Cage or other important 0/1 drops.
    Volatile Fault - Essentially this is a Wasteland that generates you a treasure when used against a majority of 4+ color decks as they aren’t normally on basic lands.

Pseudo Staples

Creatures

    Axgard Cavalry - This creature taps itself which generates treasures while also providing a way to give other creatures haste which can be quite important in some combo lines using Maskwood Nexus or Goblin Welder
    Adaptive Automaton - Artifact Dwarf that makes it harder to block our dwarves and makes Orcish Bowmaster work a bit harder to remove our dwarves.
    Magus Of The Moon - 4+ color decks are on next to no basics... or none... which limits their options substantially. Harder to counter than it's enchantment counterpart.
    Xorn - Non-Dwarf way to help generate extra treasures. This is a replacement effect so when combined with something like Roaming Throne it will make each trigger generate 2 treasures. Unfortunately requires Maskwood Nexus in order to be tutored with our commander.

Artifacts

    Damping Sphere - Shuts down lands that make more than one mana such as Gaea's Cradle while also making it potentially difficult for some decks to combo off especially decks that "Storm Off" or cast a lot of spells during their combos.
    Grafdigger's Cage - Important way to stop to field tutors and abilitiys such as Winota, Joiner of Forces, most green tutors and notable shuts down casting things from grave which stops many lines such as Underworld Breach
    Mana Vault - Mana acceleration when you need it most. A lot of variants of the deck end up in a "Draw > Go" play pattern so this can get uptapped more often than you'd think and it gives us access to casting our 4+ CMC artifacts much earlier.
    Maskwood Nexus - Allows us to tutor out any creatures from our deck with our commander and is a potential combo outlet to make infinite creatures.
    Mirror of the Forebears - This is a creature copy spell that also makes whatever you're copying an artifact in addition to what it's other types. Also acts as a way to potentially combo off through Grafdigger's Cage
    Spine of Ish Sah - Catch all removal piece that can help dig out of very deep holes especially in combination with Sculpting Steel. It is also a combo piece that lets you remove all of your opponent's permanents.
    Tangle Wire - Stax piece that acts as a pseudo vehicle letting you tap your dwarves. Strong resource denial in early game and when combined with things like Winter Orb can be back breaking.
    Torpor Orb - Shuts down Dockside Extortionist loops and Thassa's Oracle wins.

Spells

    Jeska's Will - Way to generate quite a bit of mana in many situations to help accelerate gameplan while also giving you access to some potential impulse draw. Downside is that the impulse draw portion is shut off by Drannith Magistrate

Enchantments

    Blood Moon - 4+ color decks are on next to no basics... or none... which limits their options substantially. This is the enchantment counterpart to Magus Of The Moon

Lands

    Barbarian Ring - Threshold helps you deal with problematic permanents.
    Command Beacon - Gives us a way to avoid command tax when Magda has been killed multiple times
    Great Furnace - Artifact that is tutorable by our commander and also something that can be exchanged in some situations with Goblin Welder or Goblin Engineer
    Hammerheim - Next to no downside and has profitable interaction with Magda, The Hoardmaster and Phantasmal Image
    The Mycosynth Gardens - Land that acts as a way to copy artifacts. Its floor is still high as this would turn into something like a Mana Crypt while it's ceiling is making a copy of something like Roaming Throne
    Shinka, The Bloodsoaked Keep - This is a way to help deter blockers and help opponents get through or surprisingly help remove a problematic creature another opponent unwisely blocked with. Also has profitable interaction with Magda, The Hoardmaster and Phantasmal Image
    Sokenzan, Crucible of Defiance - Generates two bodies that can be dwarves with Maskwood Nexus that generates red baseline.

Card//Combo Packages; How They Interact & Reasoning To Potentially Play Them (WIP)

This section will be explaining the functionality of some specific cards as well as the reasoning behind why it may be in some decks, the cards that go along with one another and how those sets of cards overlapping effects deckbuilding.

Something being a package card does not mean that it needs to be there with ALL other cards that can be packaged with it, just that it has specific use cases in conjunction with the base card. These cards may have individual use cases outside of the reasoning it'd be packaged with any given base card.

There are some exceptions to the rule where sometimes cards are seldom seen without one another.

It is being written elsewhere and being ported over. The current format is not set in stone.

Example;
Elixir Of Immortality "Package"

Base Card

Elixir Of Immortality

This card is used primarily as tool to facilitate ending the game through various combos enders. It also acts as a catalyst for generating infinite treasures given specific board states (such as fighting through Grafdigger's Cage) and a means of generically recurring things that have gone into the graveyard that you wish to have access to. At worst it is an extra artifact to help protect your Clock of Omens combo.

Package Cards

    Eriette's Tempting Apple - Primarily used as an infinite mana outlet in conjunction with Elixir Of Immortality to cause life loss to opponents until they are dead.
    Jeweled Lotus - Used in a few specific lines for generating infinite treasures through Grafdigger's Cage
    Lotus Petal - Used in a few specific lines for generating infinite treasures through Grafdigger's Cage
    Mirror Of The Forebears - This card functions as a way to help with specific lines to facilitate making infinite treasures through Grafdigger's Cage, normally part of the "Rube Goldberg" lines. Many times you need a "new" dwarf that happens to be an artifact to continue your combo with Clock of Omens as your others are tapped and using Liquimetal Torque would not allow you to start your combo.
    Pyrite Spellbomb - Primarily used as an infinite mana outlet in conjunction with Elixir Of Immortality to deal damage to opponents until they are dead. Also can be used as a way to draw your deck through recurring it with Elixir of Immortality
    Sculpting Steel - A card that allows you to copy any artifact, this is very useful when trying to do specific combos that look to leverage the Legend Rule for making infinite treasures, drawing your deck or winning the game.
    Soul-Guide Lantern//Stone of Erech - While they have some inherent value these are primarily used as draw loops to facilitate wins with burn spells or Twinshot Sniper
    Spine of Ish Sah - The primary use case for this is as removal to unlock the activated ability of Elixir of Immortality when something is preventing activations like Null Rod. Also functions as a way to combo and remove all of your opponent's permanents. Additionally it is used in some lines that generate infinite treasures through Grafdigger's Cage.
    The One Ring - This card functions as a draw loop with Elixir of Immortality and Sculpting Steel along with just being a baseline busted card. These draw loops can allow you to win the game with burn spells or Twinshot Sniper. This also can be used in some lines to make infinite treasures through Grafdigger's Cage.
    Twinshot Sniper - Combo ender for any draw loop with Elixir of Immortality to allow wins through Rule of Law effects.
    Unlicensed Hearse - Used in a few specific lines for generating infinite treasures through Grafdigger's Cage

Example Package Used In Actual Deck

Elixir of Immortality + Jeweled Lotus + Lotus Petal + Mirror of The Forebears + Sculpting Steel + The One Ring + Twinshot Sniper + Unlicensed Hearse

Cards here being added to a deck that are not already considered "Staples" are Elixir of Immortality, Lotus Petal, Jeweled Lotus, Mirror of the Forebears and Twinshot Sniper

This type of package provides a means of recursion, mana acceleration, multiple ways to generate infinite untapped treasures through Grafdigger's Cage, a draw loop to help dig you out of problems and provide a combo ender that wins through Rule of Law effects.

Twinshot Sniper is not required as you can end your draw loops with burn such as Lightning Bolt. However the ability to win through Rule of Law effects and the fact that it wins in conjunction with other lines adds extra value and redundancy which means its normally seen in this sort of package of cards.

Tertiary/Potential Overlap Card Example

Eriette's Tempting Apple

This card may be important when running a secondary package including Goblin Welder and or Goblin Engineer to have redundancy in the ability to give haste to target creature as there is often times situations where Cursed Mirror get used on other things, however Elixir of Immortality gives a different path to obtaining this if you have a means of consistently destroying your Cursed Mirror, putting it back in your deck and then re-tutoring it. So while it provides some overlap it may be unnecessary and may only provide a simplified line to win through Grafdigger's Cage.

Why Might You Avoid This Card/Package Type

If you are on other card packages such as Goblin Welder, Goblin Engineer and the cards that go along with it you may not value the recursion as much. Eriette's Tempting Apple may be enough when on a Welder/Engineer package to have the redundancy to feel safe with that being a main combo ender and would replace Elixir of Immortality while potentially opening up other slots because of that.

You may also feel that you have enough outs to deal with situations where Grafdigger's Cage is the piece stopping you from potentially winning as Liquimetal Torque is a staple card that will not be leaving the deck any time soon that provides a way to combo through Grafdigger's Cage that does not introduce any potential "bloat."

You may also have enough win conditions already that adding Elixir of Immortality acts as combo line "bloat" rather than being efficient. Especially for decks on cards like Terror of the Peaks // Scourge of Valkas // Realm-Scorcher Hellkite

However Elixir of Immortality does add a plethora of lines for both combo starters and combo enders. It adds a layer of safety that may be more valuable than 1-2% win percentage similar to reasoning you might run Spine of Ish Sah regardless of the packages in your deck.
Goblin Welder//Goblin Engineer "Package"

Base Cards

Goblin Welder and Goblin Engineer normally go hand in hand however there are some lists that have opted to not use welder at certain points in time. The reason for this is that while Goblin Welder can act as a combo piece unless you are specifically needing to use a legendary artifact like Eriette's Tempting Apple you can just sidestep the problem and use Sculpting Steel if the artifact you need to use over and over is above 3 CMC.

Goblin Welder can make some interesting plays swapping opponent's artifacts to potentially take them off of consistent mana like Sol Ring or Mana Crypt and force the opponent to have temporary mana again if its already been used such as Jeweled Lotus or Lotus Petal

Goblin Engineer has a bit more value up front since it allows you to put something important into your graveyard to get back or alternatively put a Cursed Mirror into your graveyard so that it can be swapped the next turn to copy the existing Goblin Engineer but the new one has haste so it acts as a way to hide your true intention of what you're looking to put into play with the Cursed Mirror copy putting the actual target into your graveyard.

The combo lines these provide can be incredibly important if you are not on Elixir of Immortality however this sorta thing can easily be shut down by effects like Rest in Peace but thankfully these types of effects are extremely uncommon in CEDH.

One downside to these lines is that if for some reason you wish to build your deck around not having Maskwood Nexus for some reason then comboing off with these creatures require them to be played from hand and a draw loop to occur in order to obtain them which is not ideal.

These creatures also act as a way to remove problematic stax pieces that we play as long as there are things in our GY to allow us to do so. Things such as Null Rod and Grafdigger's Cage

Package Cards

    Cursed Mirror - This card is required, its one of the main ways you can give these creatures haste when its most important especially in combo scenarios with Liquimetal Torque or Mirror of the Forebears
    Elixir of Immortality - This can provide lines to remove our own Cursed Mirror and put it back into our deck to be used again for our combo.
    Eriette's Tempting Apple - Another way to primarily grant haste for combo routes, this is relatively important in builds not on Elixir of Immortality
    Jeweled Lotus - A piece that can be put right into the yard after being tutored out or low enough to be accessible with Goblin Engineer ETB
    Legion Extruder - Combo piece that lets you win the game through Grafdigger's Cage similar to Eriette's Tempting Apple and Twinshot Sniper if Welder/Engineer are on field already.
    Lotus Petal - A piece that can be put right into the yard after being tutored out or low enough to be accessible with Goblin Engineer ETB
    Maskwood Nexus - This is required if you want to have these combo lines as a main means of ending games as Goblin Welder and Goblin Engineer are not tutorable without this.
    Mirror Of The Forebears - This is a backup to Liquimetal Torque as a means of providing an artifact copy of these creatures.
    Sculpting Steel - Important combo piece for many lines, also can make a copy of an existing Cursed Mirror to give haste if necessary since it will get the mirror ETB.
    Spine of Ish Sah - Potential combo piece that is just generic removal.
    Tangle Wire - As long as you can put this in your graveyard after the counters are gone its always a strong target to be brought back and keep a potential stranglehold on opponents resources.
    The One Ring - The main way we draw loop now that things like Soul-Guide Latnern and Pyrite Spellbomb don't really see play.
    Twinshot Sniper - One of the main combo lines for ending the game with welder that provides extra value when in hand with it's channel ability.

Example Package Used In Actual Deck

Goblin Welder + Goblin Engineer + Elixir of Immortality + Cursed Mirror + Sculpting Steel + Spine of Ish Sah + Maskwood Nexus + Lotus Petal + Mirror of the Forebears + Twinshot Sniper

Cards here being added to the deck that are not already considered "Staples"; Goblin Welder + Goblin Engineer + Elixir of Immortality + Spine of Ish Sah + Maskwood Nexus + Lotus Petal + Jewled Lotus + Mirror of the Forebears

This type of package provides a means of recursion via Goblin Welder, Goblin Engineer and Elixir of Immortality. It also provides redundancy for making Welder/Engineer into an artifact in Mirror of the Forebears while also being valuable in non-clock treasure generation lines via clone effects. Maskwood Nexus helps the clone lines since Xorn is often a requirement to go pseudo infinite while also providing a means of allowing Welder/Engineer to be tutored. Spine of Ish Sah gives you the ability to not only fight your way through a Grafdigger's Cage before starting the line but also can be used as a combo piece on top of providing a means of forcing your Cursed Mirror to the graveyard if you need haste since this package does not run Eriette's Tempting Apple. Jeweled Lotus and Lotus Petal are simple ways to get an artifact to the bin if you are using Goblin Welder specifically for a combo line and also provide mana acceleration, they are also targets for the ETB from Goblin Engineer which can help when comboing off. The One Ring has a draw loop that will allow you to end the game in conjunction with Twinshot Sniper or you can simply use the combo loop to win with Twinshot Sniper itself or Sculpting Steel if using lines specifically with Goblin Engineer.

This would be the package you'd use if you were looking for the safety of Elixir of Immortality

Tertiary/Potential Overlap Card Example

Eriette's Tempting Apple

This card is needed if you are not on Spine of Ish Sah AND Elixir of Immortality while providing some very interesting combo lines in conjunction with Sculpting Steel.

While this does end games easily with Elixir of Immortality through Grafdigger's Cage there are also plenty of ways to remove cage if it is a problem especially if you are on Spine of Ish Sah.

So in the end you can say that while it is a tertiary piece to the specific package above it is a piece itself that generates a new package. That new package allows potentially removing Elixir of Immortality, Spine of Ish Sah and Twinshot Sniper though Twinshot Sniper is normally considered an important backup win condition if you're on Eriette's Tempting Apple since it can still provide a win through draw loops with The One Ring and wins through Rule of Law effects.

Why Might You Avoid This Card/Package Type

While I'd say close to 80% of decks are on Goblin Welder, Goblin Engineer or the pair of them they are not required.

If you want to play a build that does not really use Maskwood Nexus then Goblin Welder and Goblin Engineer provide very minimal value and can potentially save you many slots in your deck by doing so with some tradeoffs for the utility packages like these can provide many backup win conditions.

The decks that I have seen avoiding these types of packages are normally hard stax lists that are comfortable limiting their own potential win lines. They are more likely to be able to win through combat damage over time with flying beaters or through forcing a window to go off with their only real combo lines with Clock of Omens by making the gamestate as hard to play through as possible for their opponents.

They also tend to run a more streamlined approach of "Stax the game and give myself as many opportunities to have an artifact dwarf in play to limit the amount of tutors required to win the game."

An example of such a deck can be seen here in a video I've made highlighting Gruulstavo's list;

Null Rod "Package"

Base Cards

Null Rod is a house of a card.

It interrupts so many game plans as mana rocks are an integral part of CEDH and there are also plenty of artifact abilities that also can cause some issues. This includes stopping our own "main" combo line in Clock of Omens.

One of the most important aspects of this card is the fact that it forces opponents to be unable to use treasures which run rampant in the format. This lets our own dockside generate a lot of value and potentially allows us to end games simply from opponents having and being unable to use any of their artifacts. Many players will play their own docksides with the idea that eventually the Null Rod will be removed and their treasures and artifacts will be unlocked, while that is true the risk versus reward needs to be taken into account.

While what this card can do is game warping it also warps how the deck needs to be built in order to make it's effect less impactful to ourselves. Not in that we can activate things through it, because we cannot but rather being able to still find ways to combo through it or out value our opponents over time through resource denial.

Package Cards Nullrod

    Abrade (Shatters) - If you are not on enough shatter effects it makes running this card very hard since our draw engines can be turned off with the exception of Professional Face-Breaker
    Battered Golem - "Barry" is a necessary evil in conjunction with Dwarven Bloodboiler to give a potential line through the Null Rod as you can still make infinite treasures with this combo if Maskwood Nexus is on field.
    Cavern-Hoard Dragon - The more artifacts that opponents have (treasure) the better this becomes. It is normally not reason enough to run this card but it certainly makes this dragon better than it otherwise might be.
    Dolmen Gate - This card is seldom seen but since our vehicles are shut down having a "risk free" way to attack into opponents can be quite appealing.
    Dwarven Bloodboiler - This is the second part required for the Battered Golem combo line that works through Null Rod
    Goblin Engineer - Being able to put things into the graveyard that can be swapped for the Null Rod at the most opportune time or as a way to get Null Rod into play is insane.
    Goblin Welder - Slightly worse than engineer in regards to interactions with Null Rod but if we've used anything that requires sacrifice like Lotus Petal or have had some other artifact removed it can still be quite helpful.
    Magda, the Hoardmaster - Infinite treasure outlet that functions through Null Rod. Requires Maskwood Nexus for consistency so it can be tutored.
    Maskwood Nexus - This is the only way to make the Battered Golem line work and allow us to tutor Dwarven Bloodboiler and Professional Face-Breaker which are both important.
    Plundering Barbarian - Shatter on a body, tutorable if Maskwood Nexus is in play.
    Professional Face-Breaker - This is a draw engine that works through Null Rod as its an ability of a creature and our treasures don't need to be tapped to activate it. This is an important part of finding a way to remove to the Null Rod if you don't have a way to win through it with how you built your deck.
    Roaming Throne - Gives us a secondary line with copy effects like Cursed Mirror, Sculpting Steel and Xorn to allow for us to make enough treasure to go off if we have a tap outlet.
    Scourge of Valkas - Win condition that works in conjunction with Maskwood Nexus to win through Null Rod
    Spine of Ish Sah - Catch all removal that you can get after making infinite treasures to remove Null Rod
    Terror of the Peaks - Win condition that works in conjunction with Maskwood Nexus to win through Null Rod
    Utvata Hellkite - Old school win condition that if left unchecked will take over games. Normally only used in heavy stax variants of the deck.

Example Package Used In Actual Deck

Null Rod + Goblin Engineer + Battered Golem + Maskwood Nexus + Professional Face-Breaker + Plundering Barbarian + Dwarven Bloodboiler + Spine of Ish Sah + Roaming Throne

Cards here being added to the deck that are not already considered "Staples"; Null Rod, Goblin Engineer, Battered Golem, Maskwood Nexus, Dwarven Bloodboiler, Spine of Ish Sah

This package provides you with one of the best stax pieces in the current meta Null Rod, a way to generate infinite treasures through it in Battered Golem + Maskwood Nexus and Dwarven Bloodboiler. Maskwood Nexus being a part of this potentially give access to tutor Goblin Engineer, Plundering Barbarian and Professional Face-Breaker and Dwarven Bloodboiler] while Dwarven Bloodboiler also acts as a way to let us tap for treasures with the only downside being it costs 3 to cast. Professional Face-Breaker gives us the ability to find that out we need so badly post infinite treasures while Spine of Ish Sah potentially acts as a way to help us fight through multiple problems at once or remove the null rod entirely if we need access to our artifact activations for our win line such as with Clock of Omens. Roaming Throne provides that extra pivot point in conjunction with Xorn and Maskwood Nexus alongside ways to copy the creatures in this line to generate enough treasure per tapped creature to get every creature into play or enough to generate the extra treasures required to fight through our own Null Rod and win if we don't have access to Battered Golem easily or to bridge the gap to obtaining Battered Golem to actually "go infinite."

Tertiary/Potential Overlap Card Example

Blood Moon & Magus Of The Moon

Many decks will want to concede if one of these two pieces are out in conjunction with Null Rod since their decks simply cannot function. The 4+ color decks tend to not run basics, their treasures and mana rocks are turned off so they literally cannot participate in the game. Sometimes this is even true for 3 color decks, and some two color decks will greed and not run basics because they value their utility and mana-fixing lands too much.

Why Might You Avoid This Card/Package Type

While Null Rod is great and can suffocate some decks it stops us from activating our vehicles which is the main way we safely generate treasures. The current meta for CEDH has a lot of creatures that can block, so if you don't have access to open boards or Dwarven Bloodboiler this card can actively put you behind if your opponents do not play Dockside Extortionist to enable your own to potentially just win the game for you.

A majority of the pieces that are required to really get the most out of this card and play around it are Staples or Pseudo Staples. Because of this it overlaps with a few other packages and is only a single card so the downside might not be high to add this to your list, but sometimes the mental gymnastics you have to go through to fight your way out of a problem you created for yourself can be overwhelming.

Most decklist variants aren't on more than 3-4 shatters with one being a creature so lucking into an answer isn't always going to happen. Requiring 15 treasures to get your entire combo line through it is a tall task to accomplish more often than not and if you aren't able to remove it after putting together this combo either with a draw loop into a shatter or simply by using Spine of Ish Sah then a majority of deck variants have no way to win through it at least at instant speed since Magda, The Hoardmaster exists and still allows wins via combat damage.

So this card is only really usable if you're on a lot of packages with overlap and have access to as many outs as possible including things like Goblin Welder and Goblin Engineer otherwise you risk making boards states that are hard to dig yourself out of. Alternatively you can run lines that win specifically through Null Rod but those are few and far between and often require adding creatures you may not want to have in your decklist, but thankfully Magda, the Hoardmaster can provide a great outlet that also happens to be a Staple.

Even some hard stax decks do not run this card because of how game warping it can be to our normal play patterns that allow us to progress towards a win more safely and easily.

This card is back breaking for opponents though and if you're up to the task learning to play around it is quite rewarding as long as your deck can accommodate the requirements necessary.
Maskwood Nexus

Base Card

Maskwood Nexus is an integral part of so many things that can go into Magda. One of it's main functionalities is to allow for tutoring of creatures of any type since all creatures are also considered dragons and qualify for magda's ability. It also functions as a potential combo piece to make infinite creatures and enabling some ways to make infinite treasures that are not otherwise possible.

While there are many packages you can just throw maskwood in alongside to generate extra potential value it also does have it's own packages.

Package Cards

    Axgard Cavalry - This is primarily used as combo piece as a way to generate haste for any Shapeshifter generated with the Maskwood Nexus in combination with Clock of Omens and Liquimetal Torque
    Battered Golem - Backup line to make infinite untapped treasures.
    Clock of Omens - Important combo piece for many lines including the ways to end games alongside Maskwood Nexus normally including Axgard Cavalry
    Dockside Extortionist - Being able to tutor this out when Maskwood Nexus is on field provides so much value.
    Dualcaster Mage - There are quite a few combos that can be done with Dualcaster Mage when tutored and Maskwood Nexus enables these lines.
    Dwarven Bloodboiler - There to act as a way to win alongside Battered Golem and Maskwood Nexus through Null Rod effects.
    Goblin Engineer - Maskwood Nexus enables combo lines that end the game in conjunction with Goblin Engineer and cards that are normally part of packages alongside that cade.
    Goblin Welder - Maskwood Nexus enables combo lines that end the game in conjunction with Goblin Welder and cards that are normally part of packages alongside that cade.
    Inkmoth Nexus & Other animated artifact Lands - Treasure generation is important and being able to enable your Clock of Omens combo by animating a land is quite powerful.
    Magda, The Hoardmaster - Mostly a way to allow this card to be tutored however it lets the dragons generated tap for treasures via Maskwood Nexus to win at instant speed instead of by attacking if for some reason someone has a Cyclonic Rift or something.
    Scourge of Valkas - Win condition through Null Rod in conjunction with the ability to tutor everything out of your deck with Maskwood Nexus
    Xorn - The original way to bridge the gap into untapped treasures post Clock of Omens combo in conjunction with Maskwood Nexus, just a great value piece in general and a backup if Roaming Throne is exiled or something.

Example Package Used In Actual Deck

Normally I would list out a practical set of cards here however because Maskwood Nexus gets slotted into so many packages its not really fair so I'll just list a few and the reasons they are normally added. Things like Dockside Extortionist and Magda, The Hoardmaster just get so much value by becoming tutorable targets they are able to be thrown into any package. Most importantly basically everything that goes alongside this outside of the packages below are just staples in the deck.

Maskwood Nexus + Dwarven Bloodboiler + Battered Golem + Maskwood Nexus - Generic secondary infinite treasure combo line that still functions through Null Rod effects.

Maskwood Nexus + Liquimetal Torgue + Axgard Cavalry + Clock of Omens - Combo line to win through combat damage with infinite hastey Shapeshifters.

Maskwood Nexus + Liquimetal Torgue + Goblin Welder//Goblin Engineer (or both) + Clock of Omens + Cursed Mirror + Sculpting Steel - Required pieces to win with Welder/Engineer via recursion loops.

Maskwood Nexus + Roaming Throne + Dualcaster Mage + Return The Favor + Lightning Bolt + Zoyowa's Justice - Many individually strong pieces that happen to go together into a game ending combo.

Tertiary/Potential Overlap Card Example

Eriette's Tempting Apple

This card is mostly there to provide a backup way to give haste to your Goblin Engineer, Goblin Welder and Axgard Cavalry when on variants of the deck that do not use Elixir of Immortality as often times Cursed Mirror is likely used in other ways and there are no ways to effectively get this already used artifact back onto the field in most lists so a backup means of haste generation is essentially required to not limit yourself if the recursion lines are some of your main win conditions as you lose draw loop wins via Twinshot Sniper or burn spells as a backup win condition when not on elixir.

Null Rod

If you're not on backup lines that function through your own Null Rod such as the one including Maskwood Nexus, Battered Golem] and Dwarven Bloodboiler you simply cannot "combo off" through your own stax and have to pivot into beat-down plans which many variants of the deck do not run the optimal cards to transition into. This card is almost exclusively run in mid-range lists since they can afford to give up some alternative stax pieces to add in the required pieces to still potentially present wins with this in play.

Why Might You Avoid This Card/Package Type

With the inclusion of Magda, The Hoard Master and the ability to draw your deck still in a few ways ways, even if you are not able to perform a draw loop you still have a combat win available to you since her ability is a activated ability and can be done through summoning sickness.

Being able to remove pieces that are required for secondary treasure generation methods lets you focus on a single streamlined gameplan and combo line instead using Clock of Omens. This can be quite risky but the list shown in an above video by Gruulstavo shows that this is a more than viable way to build the deck.

Since you essentially can cut so much "Fat" from the deck by taking this approach it opens you up to potentially higher card quality especially if you are on a hard stax gameplan.
The "Turbo Package" - Mana & Artifact Dwarves

This section's structure is going to be a little different. Instead of going through a single card and how things interact with that we're going to look at a list of cards that are most commonly associated with "Turbo" variants of the deck.

Turbo is looking to race to the finish and the easiest way to do that is by having access to mana and ways to force single activations from Magda being able to allow a win attempt.

Package Cards

    Adaptive Automaton - Artifact dwarf that helps make our opponents need to work a bit harder with their Orcish Bowmaster to remove our commander.
    Ashnod's Transmogrant - The floor on this card is an artifact that can help restart Clock of Omens loop and the ceiling is a game win since it lets us turn any dwarf into an artifact in addition to its other types.
    Blades of Velis Vel - This sees a lot less plays these days but its a way to turn any vehicle or artifact creature like Battered Golem into a dwarf to allow a win attempt.
    Bloodline Pretender - Uncommonly seen artifact dwarf, normally only seen when stacking these types of creatures and effects for redundancy.
    Chrome Mox - Mana rock that requires card disadvantage in order to stick on the board. This is a lot easier to make happen than Mox Diamond but depending on the list what you're getting rid of to have this in play can feel very bad.
    Gamble - This is almost always an attempt to go get Dockside Extortionist however it requires going down two cards (the cast and the pitched card) so there is some inherent risk to using it and a very large cost if whatever you get is interacted with which can result in huge tempo loss.
    Jeska's Will - Getting 7 mana to help cast a bunch of things is great but outside of very specific things or very specific hands its hard to make work the best. Theres also the risk of not having the mana required to cast relevant things exiled if you are able to use both effects. The biggest downside is that this is normally heavily telepgraphed and can eat counters you might want used elsewhere.
    Liquimetal Coating - Turns anything into an artifact, so this lets us try to combo off or use shatters to help remove problematic pieces or even destroy lands keeping players in the game.
    Liquimetal Torque - Mana rock that lets us use shatters to remove problematic nonland permanents or a way to let us potentially present win attempts. Important staple card that also enables combos through Grafdigger's Cage
    Mana Vault - Seen a lot more in every variant of the deck these days its a good way to help power out strong cards like The One Ring in early turns or even allow for earlier access to things like Blood Moon which can help shut down certain deck's entire ability to play the game if they kept the wrong hand.
    Metallic Mimic - One of the cheaper to cast artifact dwarves however it's ability forcing creatures to come down after it in order to get the effect makes it not worth running for many deck variants. However variants that want more consistency in their Artifact Dwarves being on field this card is commonly included.
    Mirror of the Forebears - Artifact dwarf that lets you win through Grafdigger's Cage so while its a pseudo staple it very much adds to that redundancy for turbo variants.
    Mox Diamond - Mana rock that requires card disadvantage in order to stick on the board. This is useful in very specific hands and normally most useful when you're on a 6 or 7 card starting hand.
    Proteus Machine - This is only seen in turbo, its a do-nothing morph card that requires being flipped to become a dwarf.
    Rite of Flame - Ritual that trades card disadvantage for mana. Unfortunately this is counterable.
    Roaming Throne - This acting as its own way to turn the corner into infinite untapped treasures from Clock of Omens loop while being an artifact dwarf is enough alone but when not doing that it just acts as another copy of Xorn in regards to treasure generation.
    Simian Spirit Guide - Uncounterable way to generate mana as its an exile effect. Card disadvantage still but better than Rite of Flame because of that fact.
    Universal Automaton - Staple, the "best" artifact dwarf as its also fetchable off of Urza's Saga

Example Packages Used In Actual Deck

Rite of Flame + Simian Spirit Guide + Jeska's Will + Mana Vault + Mox Diamond + Chrome Mox - Used when early ramp is valued over all else.

Adaptive Automaton + Ashnod's Transmogrant + Bloodline Pretender + Metallic Mimic + Mirror of the Forebears + Liquimetal Torque + Roaming Throne + Universal Automaton - Every non-useless artifact dwarf available.

Why Might You Avoid This Card/Package Type

The amount of artifact dwarves you want to run heavily depends on how consistent you want to have access to them. It also depends on your personal approach of the value of card quality over redundancy.

Examples:

Number in deck | % Chance to be seen in first 10 cards| Chance to get within 2 mulligans (going down to 6)

    10 | 67.4% | 90%
    9 | 63.3% | 87%
    8 | 58.7% | 83.9%
    7 | 53.7% | 79.6%
    6 | 48.1% | 74.2%
    5 | 42% | 67.4%

The minimal amount of "artifact dwarves" you will normally see in ANY deck is 5. Universal Automaton, Adaptive Automaton, Roaming Throne, Liquimetal Torque and Mirror of the Forebears being the most common 5th choice but sometimes you'll see something else.

These numbers are important because while the consistency of seeing an artifact dwarf may seem like it increases win percentage it is not always the key factor in determining a win as there is actually a decent amount of fragility in your Clock of Omens loop if your opponents know where to interact and have enough single target interaction to do so or you don't have enough artifacts to protect it. The practical difference between 5 and 6 is pretty low for the gameplans of decks that don't necessarily want to always be the first or even directly second to force a "make em have it" situation.

The higher number of artifact dwarves you're on the more consistent you'll see them, obviously. If you want to present wins as fast as possible at the risk of more consistently making yourself a visible threat its a viable choice but sometimes 4-5 card slots being made available can make your deck more resilient and either give you extra outs to problematic situations or give you extra potential lines if your first win attempt is prevented.

As to the mana ramp stuff... its entirely based on personal preference. At least in regards to things like Mox Diamond and Chrome Mox and your willingness/ability to pitch cards for early mana. Things like Simian Spirit Guide and Jeska's Will have been seeing less play even in turbo variants of the deck, sometimes you just don't want to be emptying your hand as it makes sandbagging interaction or bluffing interaction much more difficult and the types of hands you need to have in order to really force those early wins that absolutely require that mana are low probability to begin with. When i say low probability that number varies between 7% and 20% depending on the amount of cards you're running with effects like Jeska's Will or Simian Spirit Guide and if you're considering just your opening hand or the first 3 turns on the game as well which makes them feel statistically insignificant to many pilots when you can add other things that may have more impact.
Tel Jilad Stylus Package

Base Card

Tel-Jilad Stylus is a card that for a while had some decent support behind it. It lets you tuck things safely back into your deck that are being targeted by removal or simply to allow you to pull said card back out with your commander's activated ability.

There in lies the problem... most of the time the thing that is going to be targeted on board is our commander and putting our commander back in our deck does nothing for us unless we specifically have activated her tutor ability or can in response while simultaneously having Maskwood Nexus in play. Otherwise when we put her in the deck it just allows us to put her back in the command zone which there are very few situations where the is more beneficial than letting an opponent just remove it... such as Gilded Drake or in casual things like Oubliette.

This card also requires Clock of Omens to act as a combo piece and also requires infinite untapped artifacts to do so making it very specific as far as the win conditions you can run go. The upside is that it avoids using the graveyard so things like Rest In Peace don't ruin your day... but we have ways we can build our deck to have answers to things like this and Dauthi Voidwalker.

Originally this was seen as a potential way to win through Grafdigger's Cage but has since been determined that it is normally unnecessary as there are a plethora of other ways to either play through it or remove it adding very little value by running Tel-Jilad Stylus

While all of this is true its still a perfectly viable way to build the deck and the win-conditions you wish to use.

Package Cards

    Knight Paladin - 6/6 trampler that has crew 1 and ETB deals 4 damage to each opponent. Even without the ability to go infinite for untapped treasures theres enough artifacts to let you kill all opponents with this in most situations. This works through Grafdigger's Cage as a tutor target which is the important part.
    Legion Extruder - ETB 2 damage to any target. It's tap ability lets us use this as an engine to generate blockers/attackers for mana and treasures we've made. Works through Grafdigger's Cage as well.
    Scourge of Valkas - ETB deal 1 damage to any target. Works way better with Maskwood Nexus as outlined in the combo section. Works through Grafdigger's Cage as well.
    Spine of Ish Sah - ETB destroy any permanent... hard to play the game with permanents.
    Terror Of The Peaks - Lets us use any other artifact creature to win via infinite ETBs.
    The One Ring - Draw loop that doesn't really let us win with anything new unless combined with Elixir of Immortality, but Elixir also has its own functional draw loops.
    Twinshot Sniper - ETB deal 2 damage to any target, does not win through Grafdigger's Cage.

Example Packages Used In Actual Deck

Tel-Jilad Stylus + Spine of Ish Sah + The One Ring + Twinshot Sniper

This package gives you an out through your own cage with spine, a draw loop with TOR and twinshot as a way to end the game.

Why Might You Avoid This Card/Package Type

This card is almost entirely just a combo card and a way to potentially protect your Clock of Omens. Yes it helps get wins through Grafdigger's Cage but Elixir of Immortality can do the same in combination with other cards.

Elixir of Immortality does everything this does really and most situations can be fought through with Elixir in combination with other cards that are normally staple to the deck or part of packages that go along with elixir that may be in the deck anyway. Elixir also provides backup lines for making infinite treasures where Tel-Jilad Stylus does not allow for any new ways to make infinite untapped treasures.

The only time this might be worth running is if you are opting for one of those entirely Clock of Omens centric builds that end up leaning more towards the hard stax variants.

Frequently Asked Questions
Question 1: Why don’t we run X piece of “Fast Mana”?

Why are some pilots not running Mox Amber? Mox Diamond? Chrome Mox? Mana Vault? Jeweled Lotus? Simian Spirit Guide? Rite of Flame?

This question, or these questions I should say get asked quite often because the variance in fast mana played among decks is quite high and the reasoning to include or leave things out is not cut and dry.

This has a lot more to do with deck building philosophies and in most cases is a personal preference oriented decision rather than one that purely numbers can dictate. How things “feel” to the individual pilot matters and how they want their deck to be tuned matters just as much, be it that they want to be turbo, mid range, hard stax etc.

Mox Amber

Mox Amber

Most variants of the deck as it currently stands do not run many legendary creature outside of our commander, most lists are now off of Gimli of the Glittering Caves and Glóin, Dwarf Emissary and seemingly only “turbo oriented” lists are still on Ragavan, Nimble Pilferer. This means on average you’re on 1-3 legendary creatures with the only one that seemingly has been adopted by a majority of lists being Magda, the Hoardmaster. The severe lack of legendary creatures makes it very unlikely you’re able to use Mox Amber as a means of recasting your commander, which is the main downside to this particular piece of fast mana.

Regardless of deck variant you have a 7% chance to get it in your opening hand excluding mulligan math, when combined with the chance to get a legendary creature when most lists are only running one or two ends up being close to 1% if you push out the amount of cards seen to ten which includes the first few turns of the game. The more legendaries you run the higher this number becomes but it's still relatively insignificant since it only jumps to as high as 4% if you’re running all potentially relevant legendary creatures.

Although not being able to use this to recast our commander is a huge downside, the upside of it being active while our commander is so readily available most games can be hard to ignore for some pilots, especially if they are on “faster” deck variants. While that can be very useful we are also mono-red so our lack of card draw also must be considered when thinking about how important that extra mana may be going into the mid game if its not going to help us recast our commander, but even then a majority of lists are still running enough interaction that has a low mana value (1-2) that a single extra mana available can in some situations really make a difference.

Magda is the most likely thing to be removed, which is very relevant to how often Mox Amber is going to be active and must be taken into heavy consideration especially if the meta is running more single target removal in its current iteration.

At the very least this is a 0 mana artifact that can act as a part of protecting our Clock of Omens combo though. So even if it doesn’t help us re-cast our commander when we do have her out and we are attempting to combo off with Clock of Omens this might also put you over the amount of artifacts required on field to re-start your loop and win over the top of their interaction attempt.

Chrome Mox

Chrome Mox

The main downside to this is that you must pitch a red card. That being said with the release of Modern Horizons 3 we got two more MDFCs that will likely end up in most variants of the deck making our density of red cards that we “can do without” slightly higher.

Part of the issue though is that the card disadvantage you get from playing this can hurt quite bad, maybe not quite as bad as pitching Force of Will to your Gemstone Caverns but because of our deck’s main game plan it requires very specific starting hands for this to not feel like a “lesser of two evils” situation when choosing things to imprint. Interaction is very important for us to make sure that pesky Opposition Agent or Drannith Magistrate doesn’t just shut us out of participating in the game or at the very least make it much harder to win. Our creatures are very important as they are the main way we generate the resources we need in order to get to the point where we can combo off and win and our Artifacts with the exception of Cursed Mirror don’t fit the bill… and artifacts can’t be used as an imprint target for Chrome Mox anyway even if they have a “red pip”.

That being said, most pilots agree that this is a “necessary evil” to maintain the ability to still have the turbo style starting hands available in more combinations of cards. Afterall most decks are on 40+ red cards unlike our land count which is much lower by comparison.

At the very least this is a 0 mana artifact that can act as a part of protecting our Clock of Omens combo though.

Mox Diamond

Mox Diamond

This card is a lot harder for some pilots to reason themselves into playing.

The main reason for this is that you must discard a land in order to turn this on otherwise it goes straight to the graveyard via state based action.

Most decks are on 25-31 lands so depending on the rest of your starting hand it may potentially be difficult to warrant going down the land in order to have an artifact that can be destroyed by someone’s Gorilla Shaman or Dauntless Dismantler. While that sorta artifact destruction isn’t very common in the format there are still some decks that you need to worry about it being a potential casualty of war… mostly to decks running Dauntless Dismantler as this shares a mana value with our treasure tokens, or green decks running things like Force of Vigor.

Similar to Chrome Mox though it can indeed add some depth to your opening hands which are keepable and in the same vein are also more “turbo oriented.” This is the primary rationale behind running the card, that while going down a land can suck it can make a second seven or even your “six” more appealing with an extra land over the idea of going down further especially if the rest of the hand is able to set up a board state or interact quite a bit.

Unlike Mox Amber and Chrome Mox though this cannot be cast and stay on the field regardless, but because of that it can be helpful for lines we may want to use when combined with Goblin Welder or Goblin Engineer to remove specific stax pieces we are running to allow a win such as Grafdigger’s Cage or Null Rod.

Mana Vault

Mana Vault is something that over time has seen more inclusions across all deck variants. I’d like to say its adoption rate is closer to 90% now compared to where it was a year ago.

It essentially acts as a 1 cost ritual for 3 colorless which can be quite impactful since most deck variants sit around 30% of it’s cards as artifacts and about 10-15% more of it’s cards with at least 2 colorless required to cast it. It also lets you very easily cast up to a 5 drop on turn 2 with no other “fast mana” which can be important for some deck variants.

All variants can use 2 colorless early in the game and the downside of losing 1 HP per turn cycle is next to nothing in CEDH since a majority of games end earlier rather than later as far as amount of turns go.

So regardless of if you want to be playing early stax or simply getting some of your 3-5 drops out such as Magus of the Moon, Imperial Recruiter, Roaming Throne or The One Ring, Mana Vault lets you potentially get that push forward to either slow the game down or potentially present a win earlier.

Some pilots don’t like this card though since so much of the deck itself is on the lower end CMC/Mana Value wise and playing on curve is more along the lines of what this deck ends up doing a lot of the time.

Simian Spirit Guide & Rite of Flame

Simian Spirit Guide has inherent upside over any of the other ritual cards that “give one extra mana” as it doesn’t actually get cast to generate the mana and rather just requires it be exiled. It does have the downside of being card disadvantage in exchange for a small bit of acceleration which may or may not help much depending on the hand you’ve been dealt. It also has the upside of being able to hide you have interaction available such as Red Elemental Blast

Rite of Flame on the other hand requires it be cast and you have to use mana to cast it. This is susceptible to Mental Misstep which can be back breaking. It also has the downside of being card disadvantage as well, just like Simian Spirit Guide]. Unlike Simian Spirit Guide it is unfortunately sorcery speed only.

These types of effects are good to get around early Drannith Magistrate as well and can help you play a 3 or 4 drop on turn 2. In general though it requires very specific types of hands to really be a potential optimal play. A generic downside though is that it gives opponents a potential opportunity for a 2-for-1 and telegraphs that what you are casting may be important or worth countering.

Some pilots compare these cards to Lotus Petal and that's a great comparison especially to Simian Spirit Guide. The thing that Lotus Petal gives you that these other cards do not is that while it costing 0 is great the differentiator is that it can sit on field until it needs to be used, which can do something like bait a dockside earlier than someone might want to normally play it which we can then use as a copy target with our Cursed Mirror or effect like Heat Shimmer if you’re deck variant is on that. The biggest difference though is that this has positive interactions with both Goblin Welder and Goblin Engineer, primarily with Welder as it gives us another tutor target that can go right to the graveyard if we can sacrifice it to be used for our game ending combos. Petal also is part of combos with Elixir of Immortality to let us generate infinite untapped treasures through Grafdigger’s Cage. So Lotus Petal compared to the other two similar effects has so much more versatility and also dodges Mental Misstep.

Jeweled Lotus

Jeweled Lotus like Mana Vault has received a higher adoption rate over the past year.

One of the biggest issues for our deck is Drannith Magistrate and Jeweled Lotus gives another way to potentially dodge the Drannith. Turn 1 Magda is not always the play we want to make because attacking with her has more inherent risk than many other commanders, at least if we don’t have access to fast mana to let us play multiple things on our first turn. We’d normally rather be playing a 1 drop dwarf or two that can be used to attack on the following turn without risking the ability to make treasure itself by losing our commander.

Just like Mana Vault part of the reason this wasn’t really ran as often was that playing on curve tends to be what this deck tends to do more often than not and at first Magda wasn’t being removed nearly as consistently which made Jeweled Lotus less practical. That being said as time has gone on Magda is being removed on sight similar to Winota so potentially having access to Jeweled Lotus in the mid game can help quite a bit on top of the turn 1 play it can provide.

This card also functions the same way as Lotus Petal in the above example in regards to the welder lines and being able to put itself into the graveyard after being tutored to allow easier access to something in the graveyard to start your combo.

Jeska’s Will

Jeska’s Will - “JWill”

For a LONG time this was a staple to every variant of the deck. As time has gone there have been quite a few pilots that have opted to move away from JWill. Often the conversation comes up about why this card isn’t in some lists so I want to go through some of the reasoning as to why you may or may not run this.

As far as reasons to run this it has two potentially powerful effects. Based on the amount of cards our opponents have in hand we make red mana equal to the highest amount. The floor for this is normally going to be a pay 3 mana to generate 4 with the ceiling being quite high as there are plenty of times where an opponent may have 10 or more cards in hand. This can provide quite a bit of acceleration and potentially let us dump our hand or gain access to the mana to play things like Portal to Phyrexia or God-Pharaoh's Statue. It also gives us the ability to exile 3 cards from the top of our library and give us access to playing them, when combined with the potential mana available from the other mode this can be quite the potential boon to our boardstate. Decks where these situations may be most fruitful are ones with a higher density of low cost stax pieces since you may potentially be able to generate a board state more beneficial to you.

Like many red cards though there is some inherent risk behind playing Jwill. It attracts quite a bit of attention, especially when opponents have a lot of cards in hand, and because of the mode where it allows you to exile cards there is reason to counter the JWill itself rather than waiting for the next spell like you might for some tutors. When we are allowed to resolve this though if we are only making say 5 mana, if that's all that is available to us we very well might not be able to cast multiple things from exile and it's especially bad if we are exiling potentially important things… hitting both Maskwood Nexus and Clock of Omens as an example with minimal mana available is always a bad situation. You also only get access to both modes if Magda is out, so while it can be used to help generate the mana to re-play Magda if she's been killed a few times it still requires a very specific gamestate for that to be the case and the “floor” for the card doesn’t really do much for you since it potentially just turns into a more expensive Rite of Flame.

Simply put the floor for the card is quite low (becoming Rite of Flame) and the ceiling, while it may seem high, is also way too gamestate specific. When you can get close to “optimal” value from playing it you’re also relying on luck in multiple facets just to get that “optimal” value. This card does not “win the game” as its ceiling unless you luck into an A+B combo with enough mana and the odds of that are VERY low.

This card is also a relatively dead card if you’re either sandbagging playing your commander or if Drannith Magistrate is on the field.
Question 2: What are Magda’s best win conditions/combos?

Realistically this is a hard question to answer.

A generic answer is going to be that the best win conditions are going to be the ones that can be added or exist in the way you’ve built your deck with as few combo specific cards as you can add. Most of the time this has to do with the “card packages” you opt into playing and how those packages allow you to present wins.

Deck variants and how you want to play the deck itself change what is “best” as they have to be suited for your build and play style. Some pilots like the safety of Elixir of Immortality and others swear it is just losing overall card quality in the deck to run it.

Some deck variants even go so far as to ignore all other “combo starters” outside of Clock of Omens and focus entirely around building board states where when that comes in it can be protected when you attempt your combo rather than having extra lines that may win through specific stax pieces like Null Rod where you NEED specific pieces to do so. This also means not running effective stax pieces (like that Null Rod) that may be hard to remove for this type of deck variant and specifically having tools that allow you to still protect your win attempt them with your chosen main combo line that lets you fight through extremely important stax pieces like Grafdigger’s Cage that shut down MANY win conditions in the format.

The honest truth of the matter is… when you get to infinite treasures it doesn’t matter how you win, just that you can win. When you get to this board state ideally you should want at least two or three ways that can be pivoted into should somehow one be stopped but a lot of our win-cons have extra layers of protection you can add to ensure that you can win over the top of anything that isn’t at Split Second speed. Another reason we normally have multiple win-cons is because some combo lines simply do not work through specific stax pieces, so we either have to add extra lines to win through them or we have to add extra ways to help remove them.

An example would be that you’re trying to win with Goblin Welder and Twinshot Sniper where someone tries to exile the twinshot sniper in your graveyard…you simply use your Clock of Omens to untap your Goblin Welder that has been made into an artifact since most lines require it to be an artifact already to function and activate the ability again over the top of their attempt to remove any piece that's part of the combo line.

Winning with Magda in some ways can be a puzzle depending on the situation, but there's almost always a way to do it. If you can’t win at instant speed for some reason, you can almost always halt opponents from winning by bringing most of your stax pieces into play. Once those stax pieces are in play you can opt to “draw loop” to gain access to some interaction and they will have to fight through hell just to attempt a win or stop yours on the next turn.
Question 3: Why are dragons so uncommon now?

Dragons, while uncommon currently, will still be seen from time to time depending on how lists are built. In the past things like Utvara Hellkite, Bogardan Hellkite and Ancient Copper Dragon would commonly be seen as they all had their potential upsides, however over time the practical usage of these cards has come into question with new strategies and deck building possibilities showing their face.

Utvara Hellkite was very popular in a meta when tournaments were running 120 minute rounds. Simply having a plan of “stax the board, beat their face with a bunch of dragons” isn’t as effective when only given 75 or 80 minutes to work with unfortunately. It is still a potent card in more staxy variants of the deck, but because most deck variants in general are not on many dragons to begin with it’d take quite a few turns to get the army you might need to win.

Bogardan Hellkite was a combo piece primarily that has since been replaced with things like Twinshot Sniper. It was also part of Elixir of Immortality loops that helped generate infinite untapped treasures through Grafdigger’s Cage but since those lines were invented there have been quite a few others that have the same outcome with higher card quality or simply use other cards that already are used in the deck for varied reasons. Realistically if this isn’t being tutored it's not being cast and one of our staples Portal to Phyrexia is bad enough when it is stuck in hand, we don’t really want to increase the number of “dead cards” in hand simply to have a combo card, which you can also argue for Spine of Ish Sah but that's another topic to be discussed later. Another reason why this doesn’t see as much play is that originally it was used as a means to have a small “board wipe” of sorts, now we just rely on Portal to Phyrexia instead as it has more upsides.

Ancient Copper Dragon was seen as a way to let you 50/50 into just winning the game on its attack. This was normally done by tutoring for it on our opponent’s end step. The issue is not just that this strategy is inconsistent but rather that it requires the dragon to live to actually attack and connect for damage so it has to dodge removal and a deck having flyers to block it. On top of this Roaming Throne was introduced which when tutored at the same time in many board states just lets you threaten a win on your next turn/combat.

Things like Realm-Scorcher Hellkite (Which is arguably a strictly better version of Skarrgan Hellkite that was previously used), Scourge of Valkas and Terror of the Peaks are seen still because of their ability to end games in a simple fashion, potentially through potent stax pieces. However many pilots primarily see these specific types of dragons as “shortcut” pieces..

This idea of a shortcut piece is common when discussing win conditions that may be superfluous, especially ones that simply make your combo easier to execute or understand for your opponents. Adding cards specifically to make things easier to explain sacrifices potential card quality for that feeling of safety, similar can be said for things like Elixir of Immortality however that provides a bit more than just one thing when added to most decks which will be covered in later sections of this guide.

The potential upside to dragons outside of their ability to help us combo though is that they can provide a clock on our opponent’s life total since flyers are uncommon in the format outside of some specific commanders or hatebears and those pieces don’t often favorably trade into dragons. But a lot of lists have gone away from that “stax the board, beat down” backup plan because of the changes to tournament play over the past few years as mentioned above.

Like every other card that is added to your deck… the “why” is the most important part to answer. If you need a card to win the game because you don’t want to run a card package including Goblin Welder and win-cons through the graveyard then something like Realm-Scorcher Hellkite might be just up your ally, if you’re running Null Rod and you want a creature based win-con while you’re running Maskwood Nexus in your deck then Terror of the Peaks or Scourge of Valkas might suit your needs.

However if you’re already on other combo lines adding these types of outlets in just to simplify things may not be “optimal” but everything is up to player preference. This is also entirely based upon deckbuilding philosophies as some pilots heavily value being able to win through their own stax above all else and in this case they are no longer really “shortcuts,” while others are more of the mindset for removing the thing that is stopping the win through a variety of ways in which case they would be considered a “shortcut” and potentially not worth the slot to them.
Question 4: What's the deal with no fetch lands?

Fetch lands are something that in 60 card formats help with deck thinning, but in CEDH they are mostly there for color fixing. As we are a mono-colored deck we don’t really need color fixing and the slightest advantage you get from deck thinning is likely not normally going to be worth it.

Below is a quote describing the math behind deck thinning not really being statistically significant.

“Deck thinning can be worth it, but its effects are often overestimated. Take a 99-card deck for EDH (this can also be applied to 60-card Constructed decks and 40-card Limited decks), and say roughly 1/3 of the cards in your deck are lands. Once you’ve drawn your starting hand and are a few turns in, you’ll have around 84 cards left. If you use a fetch land to remove a single land from your deck, you’re only increasing your likelihood of drawing a non-land from 66.7% (56 non-lands out of 84) to 67.4% (56 non-lands out of 83). Considering you’re using a fetch to do this, you’re likely paying 1 life (unless you’re using something like Fabled Passage), and you really need to ask yourself if it’s worth it.” - Via: https://draftsim.com/deck-thinning-mtg

In a mono-color deck though there are a few specific cards that can make fetches worth running and those are Crucible of Worlds and Dwarven Mine .

The upside is that you can recur your fetches with Crucible of Worlds that essentially means that as long as you keep getting turns you’re going to have a much easier time recasting your commander should it continually be removed.

The downside is that you’re potentially losing out on many of the non-fetchable utility lands such as Urza’s Cave, Fomori Vault and Talon Gates of Madara among many others. On top of this you also give extra reason for your opponents to use their Opposition Agent.

Your landbase needs to be built entirely around making sure you get the most out of those fetch lands which on average means more basics that do eat into those slots for utility lands. In general you’re normally on more lands when running this kind of strategy, so that you can not only have the basics you need, but all of the fetches and land destruction lands to best put to use Crucible of Worlds.

Especially now that Magda, the Hoardmaster has been printed and is in most variants of the list it makes giving up land slots for fetches much harder as you need access to the lands that allow you to target things to commit “crimes” such as Hammerheim to maximize the value of Magda, the Hoardmaster.
Question 5: Why do we run X stax piece that can actively hurt us or turns off some of our lines?

Stax pieces such as Grafdigger’s Cage, Null Rod can be debilitating. They both prevent integral aspects of our gameplans but they also tend to be good at warping the game and preventing opponents win conditions.

While it’d be wonderful to not need to run debilitating stax pieces (and some lists do not) many pilots consider these types of stax a “necessary evil.”

To a lesser extent stax like Torpor Orb and Sphere of Resistance//Thorn of Amethyst//Damping Sphere can be problematic to our game plan but also can be integral to preventing specific win conditions or making them much tighter for our opponents allowing plenty of room for error.

Grafdigger’s Cage

Grafdigger’s Cage is a symmetrical effect that prevents creatures from entering the battlefield from libraries or graveyards. It also prevents cards from being cast from graveyards or libraries.

This particular stax piece makes it very hard to find lines that allow us to combo off. Primarily because it shuts down the ability to have creatures enter the battlefield which means that we lose access to things like Roaming Throne and Xorn that are used to bridge the gap from infinite tapped treasures to infinite untapped treasures. There's also the problem that we can’t tutor any of our other artifact dwarves to play, so our Urza’s Saga can’t get us our Universal Automaton though it can get us our Grafdigger’s Cage if we need it to. It also disables one of our alternative wincons in Battered Golem.

Most variants of the deck do have a way around this situation though. Clock of Omens is still an artifact as is Liquimetal Torque. Torque allows us to turn any dwarf we’ve played into an artifact, then that lets us go through our Clock of Omens loop to make infinite tapped treasures, then depending on decklist you either have a way to remove the Grafdigger’s Cage or have a way to make infinite untapped treasures through the Grafdigger’s Cage by using things like Grinding Station or using specific loops with Elixir of Immortality.

While at first this might seem like it prevents deck variants that win by using the graveyard alongside Goblin Welder or Goblin Engineer from functioning at a baseline it does not as both of these creature’s abilities let them remove the cage to begin their combos which makes it a non-factor. These would need to be on the field already though for that to matter as Cage does directly stop lines that require tutoring creatures. So unless you’re on an Elixir of Immortality package you’re kinda stuck finding a way to get creatures to win this primarily uses a “draw loop” to just play everything you want from hand instead of tutoring it and in this kind of a situation you should probably make sure God-Pharaoh's Statue and other stax pieces that can prevent opponents from interacting easily are on the field first.

Our opponents however aren’t as lucky. Underworld Breach is a format defining win condition currently and this prevents our opponents being able to cast things via escape. It also shuts down all “To Field” tutors such as Sissay, Weatherlight Captain ability, Kinnan, Bonder Prodigy ability and anything like Eldritch Evolution. It also stops reanimation spells that put things on field such as Lively Dirge, Reanimate and Animate Dead.

Other things this stops are things like Reality Chip, Bolas’s Citadel, Eladamri, Korvecdal, and unfortunately Power Balance. Essentially anything that lets you cast something from your library, or graveyard like Sevinne’s Reclamation flashback ability.

Another very important aspect of Grafdigger’s Cage is that there is a non-deterministic way to remove it, even without infinite untapped treasures. Namely using The One Ring in combination with the 20+ other artifacts that can be tutored allowing you to draw about half of your starting deck card total. This allows you to either draw into Battered Golem to be played and help you dig deeper or simply find your answer such as Abrade or Zoyowa’s Justice along with the mana rocks to allow these things to be cast. While this is non-deterministic it is actually relatively consistent.

Null Rod

Null Rod

This card is extremely polarizing. The one thing we need access to is generating treasures and the most common means of doing so is by using the crew ability on vehicles, which also happens to be an activated ability of an artifact. This means that game states can become difficult to navigate and get to our end goal if the board is too cluttered unless we have access to Dwarven Bloodboiler.

Magda’s ability not requiring an activated ability of an artifact means that we can potentially break parity through this stax piece. Null Rod does something that most other stax pieces do not and that is allow you to potentially out-tempo our opponents as everyone loses access to all fast mana including treasures while simultaneously preventing a multitude of prevalent win conditions in the format.

Anything involving an artifact ability is removed as an option for a win condition. This primarily affects dockside loops, underworld breach loops and most lines post Ad Nauseam as they normally have a heavy reliance on mana rocks. It also disables some sacrifice outlets that may be used in some combo lines such as Ashnod’s Altar and Phyrexian Altar while also stopping things like Birthing Pod from turning a Dargo into a Hullbreaker Horror.

In a way not being able to activate artifacts is also a boon to us due to the interaction with Treasure and Dockside Extortionist. It allows the opponents to stockpile Treasure for when they are able to remove the Null Rod with something like Chain of Vapor or a shatter. However, until an opponent is able to remove the Null Rod though it just potentially feeds the “Dockside Count” which turns any single search while a dockside is on board into a potential win for us (normally via Cursed Mirror).

Torpor Orb

Torpor Orb

Torpor does one thing, it shuts down creatures ETBs. There are quite a lot of relevant ETB effects in the format and most of them help opponents accrue value or even tutor with something like Ranger Captain of Eos to help set up specific lines. Because it stops ETBs it prevents many win conditions with reliance on them such as Thassa’s Oracle, Dockside Extortionist, Karmic Guide, Felidar Guardian and Grey Merchant of Asphodel it makes the downsides for our own deck worth it.

Most Magda deck variants don’t have many creature ETB effects. The primary tools used are Goblin Engineer, Plundering Barbarian, Dockside Extortionist and our own tutors such as Imperial Recruiter. While turning off our own ETBs isn’t great, the chances of seeing our ETB creatures is very low in general. Being able to stop our opponents from potentially being able to tutor for their Orcish Bowmaster and Dockside Extortionist while turning off Dockside’s ETB can potentially just win us games. In the games where Torpor Orb shuts off win conditions of our opponents it forces other lines or for Torpor Orb to be removed which gives a bit of information on the types of plays that might be looking to make.

Sphere Effects

Thorn of Amethyst Sphere of Resistance Damping Sphere

Sphere effects slow down spell based decks a lot more than they slow us down. While they are annoying to deal with in some situations like when you’re looking to interact or when you’re looking to play vehicles in some ways they can be a necessary evil.

Deck variants that use these are doing so because they make early advantage engines harder to deploy and slow or prevent win attempts from many archetypes. Your opponent’s Underworld Breach line becomes tighter with a normal sphere and simply not possible with something like Damping Sphere.

These effects are very simple to understand their upside, but the downside is almost always going to be that your opponents need to be able to properly threat assess and play through them. If they are too greedy often they will not be able to play the interaction they need to in order to prevent other opponents from winning, should they have lines that do happen to win through Sphere effects. This is another strength of Damping Sphere is that while it does stop specific win conditions involving many casts it does not shut down free interaction such as Force of Will to allow our opponents to stop one another.
Question 6: There's a lot of variance in the amount of “Artifact Dwarves” that are run in decks, how many is best?

Artifact Dwarf references any creature that is an artifact…and a dwarf, along with anything that can turn a dwarf into an artifact.

This is a question that is quite deep.

The first thing that you need to consider is what kind of play pattern do you wish to have for your deck? Are you trying to present wins as soon as possible, are you trying to slow your opponents while you break parity and present a delayed win? Figuring out what you want your deck to focus on matters a lot when deciding how many artifact dwarves you want, because Clock of Omens combo isn’t the only way to win.

The Options available to us are; Universal Automaton, Roaming Throne, Adaptive Automaton, Metallic Mimic, Bloodline Pretender, Proteus Machine, Liquimetal Torque, Liquimetal Coating, Ashnod’s Transmogrant, Mycosynth Lattice, Nexus of Becoming and Mirror of the Forebears

Cards that in many cases are considered low card quality; Bloodline Pretender, Proteus Machine Liquimetal Coating, Ashnod’s Transmogrant, Mycosynth Lattice (Arguable)

The reason for this is that 3 mana for just a random artifact dwarf with no other bonus is only good if you’re REALLY looking to present wins as fast as possible with the highest consistency you can. When discussing the artifacts Lattice can be good with Karn, the Great Creator and can allow you to make ALL of your dwarves into artifacts but Liquimetal Coating and Ashnod’s Transmogrant have very limited usage outside of trying to force a combo.

A vast majority of decks are only on the following; Universal Automaton, Roaming Throne, Adaptive Automaton], Liquimetal Torque and potentially Mirror of the Forebears

Universal Automaton being a 1 drop dwarf makes it easy to sandbag and play when you feel you can possibly present a win. Adaptive Automaton gives you the ability to put your dwarves out of range of Orcish Bowmaster. Roaming Throne is just insane, doubling your Magda triggers and being a one card tutor target to bridge the gap into infinite untapped treasures when doing Clock Combo. Liquimetal Torque lets you play through Grafdigger’s Cage and Mirror of the Forebears functions in a similar way but also lets you potentially make 1 treasure per turn for one mana.

Nexus of Becoming is seen in more grindy decks, and decks that focus on getting to a board state where 6 mana can be made available quickly, this archetype is primarily called “Turbo Stax”. The card draw is pretty strong but the fact that you can make any of our dwarves into a permanent artifact dwarf that is also out of Orcish Bowmaster range can be very strong on top of the fact that it's uncounterable.

Over the past year we’ve seen “turbo” decks go from trying to jam every way to have access to an “Artifact Dwarf” to a much more reasonable amount, in some cases halving the amount.

From a practical standpoint when considering mulligans there is very little practical difference between 5 and 6 artifact dwarves and in order to see practical difference you essentially need to jump two artifact dwarves at a time.

If you’re talking about just blanketly seeing an “Artifact Dwarf” within the first 10 cards of the game you get diminishing returns when going over 6 artifact dwarves. The reason being that for each dwarf above 6 you only end up getting 5% more games with an earlier potential win attempt from only having 5 treasures. Going from 9 to 10 is where you get less than 5%.

Well, how many is optimal?

The answer comes down to your personal preference. Is 5% higher chance to see one within the first 10 cards in a game worth giving up a slot in your deck that can be given to interaction, a value engine, acceleration or a stax piece? That's entirely up to you!

A vast majority of decks are running between 4 and 6. Some specialized decks such as Gruulstavo’s has “cut the fat” by removing “backup lines” to make potential wins from 5 treasures as common as possible while still being a “hard stax deck” and that works very well for him, this deck is on 9.

What you CAN manage to fit depends entirely on the “card packages” you are adding into your deck and the slots they take up, the win-cons and the “backup lines” (Like Battered Golem) you want for safety or to play through specific stax pieces all influence the “optimal” amount of Artifact Dwarves for YOUR deck.
Question 7: There's a lot of variance in the amount of Vehicles that are run in decks, how many is best?

This is a simple math problem for consistency. Either you want the effect to let you tap your dwarves with impunity more often, or you’re okay with less of this effect to gain higher card quality.

Realistically outside of the vehicles listed below finding ones that do what we want at a low enough mana value is quite difficult;

Clown Car , Unlicensed Hearse, Smuggler’s Copter, High-Speed Hover Bike, Flywheel Racer

Otherwise you’re dipping into the well and are given the following options; Mobile Garrison, Mobile Homestead, Bessie, the Doctor’s Roadster, Brotherhood Vertibird, Careening Mine Cart, Funeral Longboat, Hoard Hauler, Knight Paladin, Luxurious Locomotive, Magmatic Galleon, Rms Titanic, Sky Skiff, Skysovereign, Consul Flagship, Reckoner Bankbuster, Mighty Servant of Leuk-o

Almost all of these are either slightly overcosted with a decent ability (such as Mobile Garrison), at cost (2 or less) with a mediocre ability that may not be worth the card quality… or overcosted with attractive abilities that are unlikely to be cast in most variants of the deck and are almost never the correct tutor target such as RMS Titanic.

Things with higher than crew 2 also make it extremely difficult to use them, so things like Reckoner Bankbuster and Hoard Hauler while they can provide some interesting utility or help you get treasures if it connects… realistically getting the crew 3 is going to not always be consistent and also makes the ability to stack crews abilities on top of one another to help deal with potential interaction quite a bit harder on lower creature count boardstates.

Essentially this is the same as the artifact dwarves. Diminishing returns are the name of the game. The amount of return you get for going above 5 slows the increase in draw/seen rate to about 5% per vehicle added. Something also to be considered is if you consider Tangle Wire a vehicle or not, to some it might even count as “half a vehicle” and if you’re running Dwarven Bloodboiler since it functions the same as a vehicle but works through Null Rod.

The difference between 80% and 86% for seeing it within 10 cards and 2 mulligans is in line with the other diminishing returns. Going from 42 to 48% and from 67 to 74% is similar enough that it may be less statistically significant if the card you’re adding in place of a 6th vehicle can help you out of some precarious situations or give you redundancy for some other effect you’re looking to have more of.
