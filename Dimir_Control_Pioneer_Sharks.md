Building the deck "BOB the Dog Dimir" picked this deck becuase it didnt need the expnsive sideboard card plus I had 2 thoughsiezes $50 savings)
This is the deck:
https://www.moxfield.com/decks/db37Bb0zmECF6AwFAM2q0Q

Expense tracker (lets not go overboard like I did for Lotus field)

24.99 for Azouris control (why did I spend this much for a shark typhoon and a few other commons again with the stupidity)
37.99 is for the base deck on amazon

Cardkingdom, TCG and Amazon onlything missing is The Meathook Massacre, currely a proxy when the card goes less than $30 then lets snatch it up
