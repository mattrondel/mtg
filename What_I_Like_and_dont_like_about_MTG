What I like and hate about MTG

Likes:
A way to meet face to face with people and talk about a common interest
it enchances reading and math skills, moments like you can only dela damage to me if you can add it all up is what I told the kids
the art is still what interests me


Hate:
Its expensive, like to maintain a deck and follow all the cards coming out its pricey
The endless sets coming out monthly (yes literally on a monthly basis) this gets expensive, due to this it fells like this makes 
Secret lair seems like anti competive to the local stores , like why sell a direct to consumer product why not support the lcoa guys and kepe them in bussiness so they can keep you in business?
trading casrds with people rather difficult as everyone tends to have cards from different sets and in most cases they want your cards but they have nothing you want 
Sets are a lot larger and with muiple printing os them it makes it increaingly difficult to collect all from a a set, take pyrexia all with be one if you wanted a complte collection there over 500 cards!
buying good singles cards that are moderly priced often makes you feel burned like you wasted cash becuase new sets pump out reprint like take commander matsers and wilds of eldrane:
these card I had bought then within a two months span cards got reprinted several times 
  Morophon (muliple repritings in commander masters)
  Cyclonic Rift (muliple repritings in commander masters)
  The meathook massacre (done in "The List reprints" in wilds of eldrane)
ethically I wonder about hasbro like when the youetuber was sent the wrong set by mistake and the company sent over a organization that has a histroy of stoppiing unions, that and the reserved list with they ended up printing 30th aniversary proxy cards at a $999 price tag
