Played 2 games on 11/15 one on one with Mike S
first was a misplay with copper dragon should have played it end of his turn then attack on mine this eventually allowed him to win but i held on, commander need recasting twice once was with the commd tower land 
game two i won but getting the win is a bit slow and takes a lot of cards to pull off, in this list its unclear how I win I think its grinding station but its not as direct as realm scorcer dragon
key cards played:
the MDFC MH3 red land is nice
magus of the moon slowed him down and was very valueable
portal to phyrexia killed the collector ophe
Paradise mantle while mid to late game it appeared was still a welcome card to see 
Copper dragon I'm thinking it's not that great 
right of flame was awesome
