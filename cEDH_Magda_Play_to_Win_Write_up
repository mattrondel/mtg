Test

Okay some more general notes before I do a longer writeup when I'm home.

Deck list takeaways:

- I think a lighter stax list, with blood moon / null rod is where you want to be in the current meta. Null rod is one of the most game warping cards for sure, but needs to be deployed with caution. It's extremely strong at choking out all colors combined with moon, mana with GPS, or just slow the game down. I also got a free win on a mull to 4 with a turn 1 blood moon.

- The battered golem package is a must imo. People just don't know this line and the fact that it can win under so many stax pieces. I won the finals by telling the table I can't clock under spellskite, which made me not look like an immediate threat, then getting this line. It's also a lot harder to interact with once it's on onboard, as any tapping dwarf puts another win attempt on the stack.

- I'm still not 100% sure if you need elixir alongside welder/apple, but I chose it as it's my most familiar combo piece. I just like having at least two cards in deck that allow you to win on the stack if you lose one (welder lines require maskwood to be in play, or eng/welder already out).

- Welder/engineer are a little clunky, but open up a ton of sneaky lines, so they are worth playing. My favorite is cursed mirror as first entomb, then be able to bring it back, copy engineer again and get a hasty reanimate that's hard to interact with.

- This list has a really hard time into turbo pods, but the tournament meta is mostly blue midrange, so I think you just take those losses for a better percentage at fighting in more common pods.

General tournament takeaways:
- Politics carries this deck, so be yapping 24/7. You need to be extremely vocal about who the threat is and what stax pieces you can get if they let Magda live, or the fact that you want to play it defensively, even if that's not 100% true (although don't lie if you made a promise). People have terrible threat assessment and will just repeat kill Magda for no reason unless you give them a good reason not to.

- Sandbag, sandbag, sandbag. Don't jam your win attempts unless you actually think you have a window or resources have all been spent. We win instant speed without spells so aim to go over someone if you are stuck in a midrange pod. Also play parasitic and don't get bullied in priority if you think other decks have answers to threats. We simply do not draw enough cards to try and police the table, let those blue midrange decks handle it. Keep your interaction to protect your wins if you can.

- I mulled a ton during this event, I think I only kept a single 7, mostly 5/6s. Our mediocre 7s cannot get there and we must be making explosive or back breaking stax plays fast, or at the very least setting up consistent treasure generation into a slow pod.

- Drawing early is risky, not 100% sure I would draw round 3 again on a 5 round event. Only a couple of the 2-0s got the draw in cleanly.

As promised here is the long, late-night tournament reports from the event. I did my best to remember everything that happened, but my brain was mush by round 4. I'll take notes after each round next event so they are a bit more detailed.


Me, Evelyn, Tivit, Breya
1-0-0
T1:
I take a pretty good mull to 4 of universal automaton, clown car, mana crypt and land.

I rip blood moon as my first draw and slam it, the game was basically over from there. Breya was able to play a ToR on turn 1, but Tivit and Evelyn both just land pass.

T2:
I had a universal automaton, Magda, and clown car, and another land the following turn. Land pass from the other 3 players.

T3:
I think the early nerves got me and I make a small but very bad sequencing error. I draw into molten duplication which should have just ended the game with clown car, crypt, and an untapped clock, but I tap the mana crypt to play the duplication meaning I can't win that turn. I decide to just go for a GPS and try to push my lead.

T4/5:
No other relevant game actions from my opponents aside from ToR draws and I clock kill on T5.


Standout Cards: 
- Blood moon

General Notes: 
- This was a great example of mulling mediocre hands away and being rewarded for keeping explosive low card hands, even though I did get extremely lucky with the moon top deck. 
- I got GPS after my poor sequencing, but it 100% should have been null rod. I'm 99% sure this pod has no out to moon/rod, but I instead let Breya get two more turns of draws with one ring before I won. Got lucky they didn't rip a dockside after seeing so many cards.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Me, u/w Heliod, Rona, Kinnan (my friend)
2-0-0

T1:
Kept a decent six on the power of dockside. Played dwarf turn one and passed. Heliod played a fish T1 and both Rona, Herald of Invasion and Kinnan didn't want to feed, so they very conservatively deployed to the board.

T2:
I played Magda, made a treasure and played welder and passed. Rona and Heliod land pass. Kinnan felt they were going to be too far out of the game at seat 4 and jams 3 rocks into fish.

T3:
I play a dockside for 5, get GPS and play a null rod from hand which basically locks the other decks from progressing their boards forward for 2 turns as they need to hold interaction.

T4:
I ripped an engineer off the top and pitch roaming throne into my yard and reanimate it with welder. Kinnan tries to go for a precombat boseiju on throne, but didn't realize it had ward and it fizzles. I swing, make treasures and pass.

T5:
I win this turn after going to combat once more, getting the golem line, and welding away my null rod after.


Standout cards:
- Null rod
- GPS
- Welder/Engineer

General Notes:
- Engineer being able to entomb any artifact for welder is extremely powerful, my opponents were not really sure what I was going for.
- I had to call a judge on my friend during the boseiju play, my opponents tried to roll it back after the ward trigger and costs were paid, stating that it was okay since priority was never passed (lol). No one got rude about it or anything but you should always feel empowered to call a judge if you aren't sure about a ruling, or if your opponents are insistent on a ruling you think is incorrect.

Kenrith (Cam from PtW), Kraum/Kodama, me, Sisay
2-0-1

We spent 15 minutes of this round trying to do tournament math to see if it made sense to draw or play it. We ended up drawing hoping we could just all continue to do that for the next 3 rounds and make top 16 (since this event was 4 points for a win, and 1 for a draw). 

We played one cause we came to game, which I don't remember much of to be honest since we were all kind of just having fun and cracking jokes. I was personally really excited to be able to play/chat with Cam since I'm a big fan of PtW (both him and Dylan were super awesome).

I do remember Cam jammed an early rhystic and got a ton of value. I had a turn 3 tanglewire that slowed the table down quite a bit, but I was forced to expend my tutor on turn 4 for a portal to kill basically only a bowmaster cause my opponents were going to just not pay rhystic to kill my board. Sisay and kraum didn't do much under the early tanglewire. Cam was able to close it out around turn 6/7 with a protected throacle win after seeing so many cards.

----
Codie, Sisay, me, Etali
2-1-1

Got paired down and was never really in the game on this one. I kept a responsible 5 in 3rd seat that had 1 drop dwarf, 2 lands, torpor orb and plundering. I made it pretty clear to Sisay that we needed to try to play to get my interaction on board to not just immediately lose to both turbo decks. Unfortunately they OBM me pre combat on turn 3 and I'm forced to only play torpor orb. Etali nature's claims it EOT, slams Etali, but whiffs. Codie untaps with him on board going into turn 4 and easily wins.

Standout cards: none

General Notes:
- Getting the pair down sucked, I believe 4 people ended up being able to draw in from here. That's the risk you take with this though, can't be mad about it.
- This match was my only real politics blunder. Sisay was not familiar with Codie, I should have pushed the table harder that he will just win if he untaps. I wish I could have fought harder to at least have the OBM come down and kill Magda after I expended my treasures for the stax pieces, but Sisay just jammed (he did say it was a misplay post-game).
- I should have deployed the plundering to kill Codie instead of torpor orb. Etali is non-deterministic and can whiff (which was shown the following turn). Codie usually just wins if he untaps. I can also try to convince Etali to interact with Codie before his turn if I don't deploy a stax piece that hurts him.
- Very possible I try not to keep a responsible hand in this pod in 3rd seat, but I didn't want to try for an explosive 4. I just don't think I ever out-goldfish these decks.
- Double turbo pod is horrible for the deck, but that is okay! I knew going into the event I would get chewed up by a pod like this, but it was the only one I ran into. I had good conversion rates against midrange, which is what I was hedging against.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Magda, Tivit, Malcolm/Tymna, me
2-1-2

Another weird round where we were all trying to squeak into top 16 through a draw and breakers. The other Magda pilot in the pod needed a win to top 16 so we agreed to play it out, but draw if anyone other than him won.

Was a bit of a slog of a game, Magda #1 played very fast to the board but got hit with early removal. I was able to slowly build treasures mostly un-interacted, playing a very small value dockside to force treasure usage. Both Tymna and Tivit were mostly just draw go-ing with their generals in play. I tutored a portal to reset the board and null rod to try to choke them off the treasures / time sieve. Around turn 7, Magda #1 gets Uba Mask out. Tivit just swings and passes. Tymna flips a Teferi off the top, protects it, bounces the rod and wins.

Standout card:
- Null rod
- PtP

General Notes:
- I actually almost threw this game hard to the other Magda pilot, I need to get some reps of the mirror in now that we are putting up so many Ws (hehe). The onboard null rod stranded a ton of artifacts from the two esper decks, and I was left with a dockside in play, while he had a regular cursed mirror on the field. Tivit did an end of turn whir towards the end of the game, which the other Magda player return to favored. If he got sculpting steel targeting mirror, targeting dockside, it was gg. I nicely let him know of that line afterwards and told him to join the discord as it's a great way to keep on learning since he seemed like he might have been a newer-ish pilot.
- The three person draw, one person win agreement on these last round swiss events when you have good breakers was huge. It's a fair way to give everyone at the table the best chance to get into top 16, as long as the pod doesn't just try to kill the one guy who needs a win lol (which we didn't). My friend almost made top 16, and he would have if he did this.

Top 16
3-1-2

Sisay, me, Blue Farm, Blue Farm

This was a lonnnggggg 2.5 hour game. Both blue farm players got their tymna / kraum / other creature engines online fast, and Sisay got an early lotho. Lots of attacking, drawing cards and passing.

By turn 5 the boards were pretty clogged up but no real win attempts were put through. I have a board with a dwarf, xorn, Magda and five treasures and some artifact mana. Blue farm #2 goes for a large dockside. I'm able to cursed mirror it with etb on the stack and make 8 treasures, then tutor out a null rod to stall.

On turn 6 I'm able to get to 8 treasures. Blue farm #2 bounces null rod and goes for a peer into the abyss. Huge counter war happens, but I'm able to sandbag my stuff till the very end. I tutor with Magda, hold priority, and return the favor to change peer to myself and double tutor. I go for clock throne, but get my untap swatted and Magda bounced and I can't continue. I do get to peer for like 40 card though. I then get brain freezed down to 20 cards, leaving me with no actual combo line. Blue Farm #2 also gets brain-freezed to basically nothing.

Once it's my turn I get ranger captained but get to cast 5 dwarves in my hand with blood boiler, xorn and throne and make a bunch of treasures, but I almost punt and discard assuming I had elixir in my deck (which got milled). I end up barely getting there with beats over two turns, burning out blue farm #1 on their upkeep, and removing blue farm #2 / Sisay's board from the removal spells off my remaining 7 post peer, and tutoring the spine/twinshot in my deck.

Standout cards: 
- Null rod
- Return the favor
- Peer into the abyss (?)

General Notes:
- This game win was brought to you by sandbagging / politics. I chatted my ass off this game to stay in it. The blue farm players saw so many cards just from going draw engine pass (classic blue farm). I was able to convince everyone to just let me hold up my tutors defensively so we don't just lose to any one person, specifically blue farm #2 since he was furthest ahead. This actually worked cause I saved us with null rod, but also let me get a couple sneaky treasure with the cursed mirror line before my null rod tutor (and every treasure counts). I also played the Peer stack really well by holding my return the favor/tutor until the end. Something like 7 spells went on the stack before I snuck in to try to win (the peer redirect ultimately won me the game).
- I did the actual funniest thing on the last turn cycle, both my hand and graveyard were like 40 cards and just on the table. Sisay asked to see my graveyard since he has agatha's, and I straight up passed him my hand lmao. I took it back pretty quick but we all had a laugh about it, that's what 10+ hours of cedh does to a man.

Finals
4-1-2

Malcolm/Kediss, Malcolm/Tymna, me, Kinnan (Tyler from PtW)

This was a much faster game. I keep a shaky 5 with dualcaster, mountain, saga, universal, and maskwood.

T1:

Kediss plays a fish. Kinnan and tymna both play pretty reserved on turn 1, just playing a llanowar and spectral sailor respectively. I play a urza saga and universal.

T2:
Kediss pays fish and land passes. Tymna gets Malcolm on board and makes a treasure. I played Magda make a treasure. Kinnan plays him and a spellskite. Politics start here as they are worried I'm able to just go for a win on 3/4, however I let them know I can't clock through spellskite and would rather hold a defensive tutor in the next few turns, which they agree means I'm not a win threat.

T3:
Kediss pays fish and passes. Tymna gets her on board and starts making two treasures and drawing two. I tutor a sol ring with saga and slam my maskwood. They get nervous again but I let them know it does actual nothing on my board full of dwarves. Kinnan feeds fish and plays a rock and is able to spin with cradle, only hitting a sky turtle.

T4: 
Kediss can't pay, has no land and passes. Tymna attacks me this time, and I'm able to get a maskwood token into play to try and block her. This forces a deadly rollick so tymna lives, which ends up being huge. I get to 5 treasures and pass. Kinnan land passes.

T5: Kediss plays land Malcolm pass. Tymna attacks then goes for thoracle on main phase two. Tymna has two counters for backup, but we stop it with a missed kinnan spin, force, delay, and my dualcaster copying force. I was able to politic me holding a last defense tutor if we lost the counter war cause I can't clock under spellskite, but my torpor was in hand 😮‍💨. They were not familiar with the golem line and I was pretty sure all interaction was exhausted, so I tutor bloodboiler eot, making two treasures from the dwarf dualcaster and bloodboiler. I untap, tutor golem and win from there.

Standout cards:
- Dualcaster
- Maskwood
- Bloodboiler

General Notes:
- Another good politics win, I had two points in the game where my opponents felt I was a threat, but I was able to dissuade them. By revealing spellskite as an unknown (to them) stax piece to clock combo, I evaded being threat #1. Also just pointing out maskwood did nothing for my board at the time was big, cause they were legitimately not really sure what it was for.
- I'm also almost positive they we're not familiar with the golem line, how much stax it gets under, and the fact that maskwood being out cut the tutor's from 3 -> 2.
- Really happy with how I played the semi-finals and finals. The finals was my cleanest match of the day, which was crazy because it was so late. The semi-finals was definitely the game that I came back from being the most behind in.
