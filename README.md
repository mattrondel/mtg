Magic rules
when buying packs preview the set first qty in set , whats good to look for and over all value
opening packs for the joy of it but lowest cost per pack possible

singles:
anything over $10 dont buy - proxy , trade online for high dollar ones

no buying in august make all overs prior to August. If you want to run something make a laser print color copy first and run that deck a few times before buying it (since no one cares about proxies)
