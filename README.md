new magic rules for the next month:

no card buying, no card look up at work

homework only, yes really.

no going to shop unless family wants to go

if downtime in house then homework review, same with work

if co-workers/friends ask tell then your focusing on homework this last 28 days as you dont want to spend 2500 again .

Magic rules
when buying packs preview the set first qty in set , whats good to look for and over all value
opening packs for the joy of it but lowest cost per pack possible

singles:
anything over $10 dont buy - proxy , trade online for high dollar ones

no buying in august make all overs prior to August. If you want to run something make a laser print color copy first and run that deck a few times before buying it (since no one cares about proxies)
