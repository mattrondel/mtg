THE BATTLE FOR TIME AND SPACE BEGINS!

This is a Battlebox with a shared library. Each player draws 4 cards and has a ten card sideboard featuring five basic lands and five allied tapped lands.

Path to Exile: The owner of the targeted creature can select a basic land from their sideboard and put it into play (not dual tapped land).

Screwdrivers are legendary for this box (Laser or Sonic).
