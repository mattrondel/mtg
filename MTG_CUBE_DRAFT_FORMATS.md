Cube Draft Formats

*Booster Draft*

The classic draft experience. Modeled after Booster Draft with sealed packs.

**How to Play**

Each player begins with three stacks of 15 random cards from the Cube. Starting with the first ‘pack’ of cards, players secretly choose one, and passes the remaining 14 cards to the player to their left. Repeat the process until all cards from the first set of packs are drafted. Draft subsequent packs the same way, alternating which direction cards are passed with each pack.

After the draft, players take their pool of 45 cards and build a deck with a minimum of 40 cards using any number of the cards they drafted and basic lands.

A standard Cube Booster Draft emulates drafting with sealed booster packs. Drafts are usually 3 packs of 15 cards, and often played with 8 players. Unlike sealed boosters, packs are typically completely randomized by shuffling the whole Cube and out cards.

**Playing Games**

With 8 players, a three round tournament is most often played. In the first round, players are matched against the player across the table from them, furthest in the draft order. In subsequent rounds, players are matched against players with the most similar win record.

**Advantages to Booster Draft**

Booster Draft is not popular by accident. It’s the most popular way to play Cube and is often synonymous with Cube drafting. Many of the other draft formats are based on it with some adjustments. The draft takes relatively little setup, and players familiar with Limited drafting already know the process.
Variations

**Adjusting Number of Players**

Although 8 players is often preferred, since it leads to a tidy three round tournament, Cube draft is extremely flexible. 3 packs of 15 with 8 players is a good baseline with a lot of precedence but the number of players, packs, and cards are all flexible.

The standard pack breakdown is ideal for 8 players, but works with anywhere between 4 and 10 players. For smaller groups a larger number of smaller packs works well, 4 packs of 11 or 5 of 9. Smaller packs emulates the experience of the standard draft and avoids seeing the same packs many times.
Variable Pack Sizes

Unlike a sealed Booster Draft constrained by Magic’s products, the pack size and number of packs are completely customizable in this format. 15 card packs is a familiar baseline with a fair degree of complexity, but there are good reasons to vary that number. A higher number of smaller packs is especially good for smaller groups, since the number of cards that ‘wheel’ back to their starting player is lessened, so the pack doesn’t get stale. The total number of cards drafted is also not fixed. Increasing the pack size adds some complexity which can be desirable. Increasing the total number of packs allows players a larger draft pool, giving them more agency in deckbuilding and sideboarding. Increasing the pool size can also let a cube designer add many more fixing lands to the cube without decreasing the total number of spells in player’s draft pools.
Team Draft

In a Team Draft, players compete as a group. It works especially well with groups of six players and many prefer it specifically with a group of six to avoid some awkward pairings that would happen with a six player tournament. It changes the dynamics and optimal strategy of the draft itself, allowing players help teammates during deckbuilding and games.
Constructed Packs

While most often packs are composed of a number of randomized cards, it’s also possible to structure the packs in one way or another to change the draft experience. Packs can be collated by shuffling in a way to create a more consistent distribution of colors or effects. Rather than dealing out cards randomly, packs can also be structured with particular ‘slots’ from different groups of cards to make sure everyone has an opportunity to some particular effects.

**Burn Draft**

The draft can be varied by having players ‘burn’ cards from packs in addition to drafting cards into their pools. In a Burn Draft players, for example, take one card and set another aside before passing the pack. The exact breakdown is variable and cards can either be burned with each pick or some number of cards at the end of a pack can all be burned together. Burn Draft is often used as a way to add more hidden information to drafts with small groups, or allow players to have more choices without expanding draft pool sizes.

**Desert Draft**

Desert Draft is a novel way to play where basic lands are shuffled into the Cube before making packs. Unlike a typical draft, players don’t have access to basics lands to add to their decks after the draft. Instead you have to decide how highly to pick them.

**Logistics**

Cubes intended for Booster Draft are typically 360 or more cards to allow for an 8 player draft of 3 packs of 15 cards. Larger Cubes introduce more variation between drafts or support larger numbers of players. For Cubes intended for smaller groups a smaller list works just fine.

For most cubes, around 30-40 basic lands of each type are needed.




***Burn Draft***

Burn Draft is a variation on standard booster draft, each player opens a pack and passes it along to the next player, but in addition to picking cards for their deck, they ‘burn’ some number of cards which are removed from draft.

The format is typically used for a smaller group of players to emulate the experience of an 8 player pod by drafting with a larger set of cards than necessary for the group and ‘burned’ cards emulating picks by additional players.

**How to Play**

The draft follows the structure of a typical Booster Draft with a larger number of packs and cards ‘burned’ at every pick or specific points in the draft.

As a baseline, for 4 players: create 6 packs of 15 for each player (24 packs). Each player opens their first pack, drafts one card into their pool, and then removes an additional card from the pack before passing it to the next drafter. The additional cards are removed from the draft entirely. When no cards are left in the first set of packs, players open the next pack and repeat the process passing in alternating directions.

After the draft all ‘burned’ cards are set aside and players build decks and play games as normal.

**Variations**

There are many Burn Draft variations by many names which vary the number of players, packs, cards in a pack, and how many cards are burned with particular picks. Alternatively to removing cards with each pick, a number of cards at the end of a may be removed instead.

Generally the goal with variations is to scale down a draft designed for a certain number of players to a smaller group, so it makes sense to keep pack size similar, increase the number of packs per player, and burn a proportion of cards similar to the missing players.

**Advantages to Burn Draft**

Burn Draft is easy learn for players familiar with drafting and doesn’t involve any additional setup, making it a great choice for those nights where one or two players are a no-show.

For cubes designed to be drafted with a precise number of players and players expect to always have the possibility of drafting particular micro-synergies, burn drafting can allow a smaller group to draft the entirety of a cube while drafting normal size pools.

Some players also prefer Burn Draft to give critical-mass decks a fighting chance (think Mono Red aggro in many classic legacy cubes), since they require a particular density of cards to be competitive.

**Limitations**

Burn Draft introduces a new layer of complexity and meta decisions to the draft. This could be a pro as well, but this editor has not experienced anyone making burn picks with interesting agency other than a weird form of hate drafting. The result of this is often counter to the goals of the format, leading to cards that are leaders among synergistic packages or part of easily targeted micro-synergies get burned on a whim. The alternative form of burning cards only at the ends of packs rather than with each picks largely avoids these issues.
