**** Draft Setup ****

•	Everyone starts with 3 packs

•	Starting with left pick 2 cards (or 1)

•	Goal is to build a 40 card deck including lands (not a hard limit just a goal, more is ok)

•	Once each of the packs are depleted then pass to the right repeating the process

•	An even number of players is recommended so that no bye happens, and no is stuck waiting.

•	Play best-of-1, not best-of-3. So, 1 game between 2 players, and whoever wins that game wins.

•	Everyone plays against everyone (time permitting)

•	You play EVERYONE, once. If you have a lot of time, you play everyone, twice. For 7 I suggest everyone once (6 games per player), if you're with 5, go round twice (8 games per player).

## ****Points of Courtesy / Rules **** ##

### No Hate Drafting ### 
this means drafting a card out of a pack that you zero intention of playing or putting in as sideboard/alternate. The only reason you’re taking it is that you’re keeping it from somebody else at the table. 

•	No Shiny card Syndrome – Don’t take a card simply because it’s big, flashy and/or a mythic rare take it because it will work well in your deck. 

•	No Copy Limit – there is no limit on how many copy of a card can be in a deck – if you draft 10 poison dart frogs you can play them all

•	Keep Quiet - Don’t talk about the contents of your pack that you’re looking at this is giving up a lot of information what’s in the packs.

•	Zone Draft - There is a "zone" between each player and in each player's hands. No more than one pack can be in a zone at once. So if the player to your left hasn't picked up the pack you passed them, you're not allowed to pass them another pack. Again, don't pass 
until somebody is ready.

Draft tips:

B.R.E.A.D. or Priory of what to pick.

Bombs: - your opponent’s biggest threats. If your opponents cannot get rid of them, they will "go off" and win you the game

How do you know if it’s a bomb? Is this a big creature, preferably one that is hard to block (added evasion), basically things that have a strong impact on the board?

Things to ask when choosing:

Does the card have a significant effect or ability that provides you with significant card advantage? 

Card advantage is defined as a player having access to more cards than another player, usually by drawing more cards through in-game effects. You can also achieve through causing your opponents to discard cards, and to a lesser extent simply by mass removing cards from 
their battlefield. 

Does this card provide game-breaking effects, such as that of planeswalkers



Removal: Counterspells, destroy, or exile effects. Removal removes the threat. Bounce spells like return target creature to owners’ hand are removal.

Combat spells and tricks can be used as removal as well. Pumping your creature so that it can now block and kill an attacker is a form of removal as is flashing in a creature strategically for surprise blocking. 

Evasion: Attackers that can prevent opponents from blocking. Flying, menace, horsemanship trample, etc. being able to attack without the possibility of your opponent’s blocking is partially strong. 

Aggro: creatures that are neither bombs, nor have evasion, but apply pressure and can fill holes in your mana curve. Sometimes these are cards that have weaker abilities that don’t win you the game, but help you win the game. Aggro is sometimes called ability cards. 
Aggro should be taken with mana curve in mind. Aggro could also be called anything else

Dirt -Your worst cards. Your duds. The cards you would never, ever play. Typically, dirt tends to be all that is left in the remaining 5 or so cards but this varies. Dirt can sometimes have a role in your sideboard. Your sideboard is all the cards you drafted but did 
not use in your deck.  Sometimes dirt can be situational cards that you might sideboard in between games. 



Deck Building tips:

A 40 card deck is your goal and a recommended deck (cards permitting)

About 16 creatures

About 7 non creature spells

About 16-18 lands per 40 card deck

24-25 lands in a 60 card deck (if this is your goal)



Mana Curve – you want to cast a creature every turn if possible or you want to have creatures with varying mana costs. 

Mana curve template:

1-2 mana = 5-7 cards

3-4 mana = 7-10 cards

5-6 mana = 1-2 cards

8+ mana = 0 cards

13 creatures are absolute minimum 16-17 is ideal.
