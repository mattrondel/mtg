Introduction
Combo "Starters" - Infinite Treasures
Basic means of Generating Infinite Treasures (Staxless)

** Clock Of Omens Loop **

Clock of Omens is an artifact that allows us to use any "Artifact Dwarf" as a means to generate infinite tapped treasures which can convert to infinite untapped treasures through a few means.

This requires a board state of Magda, Brazen Outlaw + Clock of Omens + any Artifact Dwarf (AD)

    Tap Clock of Omens + Artifact Dwarf such as Adaptive Automaton targeting the automaton with Clock's ability to untap it. This will trigger Magda, Brazen Outlaw when the AD is tapped as part of the cost to use Clock's Ability which will generate an untapped Treasure
    You will then tap the AD and the newly made Treasure targeting your AD which will trigger Magda, Brazen Outlaw again in order to untap your AD generate another untapped treasure Treasure. This leaves you with one untapped treasure, an untapped Artifact Dwarf and a tapped Treasure
    From here you continue this loop of tapping the new untapped Treasure and the Artifact Dwarf to use Clock of Omens ability targeting the Artifact Dwarf in order to generate infinite tapped Treasure and leave you with one untapped Treasure
    Win the game from here with infinite Magda, Brazen Outlaw activations that lead to varying Combo Enders

The most common second step will be to make infinite untapped treasures by using either Roaming Throne or Maskwood Nexus + Xorn and repeating the Clock of Omens loop generating an extra untapped treasure each loop and then performing your preferred "Combo Ender."

Its important to note that things like Liquimetal Torque and Mirror of the Forebears can act as ways to either copy a dwarf as an artifact creature or simply make an existing dwarf on your board into an artifact with Liquimetal Torque's ability.

** Maskwood Nexus + Battered Golem **

Maskwood Nexus provides our deck a way to turn our non-dwarf artifact creatures into dwarves while also giving us a way to use our vehicles as artifact dwarves after they have been crewed.

This combo is very simple.

You need Magda, Brazen Outlaw + Maskwood Nexus + Battered Golem in play along with any means of tapping your dwarf/creature such as Dwarven Bloodboiler or any vehicle via the Crew Ability like Clown Car

Once they are on field do as follows:

    Tap Battered Golem to crew your vehicle or activate Dwarven Bloodboiler's ability. This will then trigger Magda, Brazen Outlaw to generate a Treasure as Battered Golem is now considered a dwarf as Maskwood Nexus makes all creature every creature type. The Treasure entering the battle field will cause Battered Golem to untap and be able to be tapped once more.

This is the simplest way to make infinite Treasure because they will all be untapped unless there is something forcing them to come into play tapped like Dauntless Dismantler.

Generating Infinite Treasure Through Varying Stax

** Grafdigger's Cage **

Grafdigger's Cage is an annoying card when it comes to potentially winning the game for many decks. For us it stops our ability to take creatures out of our deck which in turn means that it can be hard to navigate winning. Creatures are especially important to generating infinite untapped treasures in most scenarios such as Battered Golem, Roaming Throne, Xorn and the rest of our Artifact Dwarf suite under normal circumstances but are not actually required to be tutored out of our deck to allow us to actually make infinite treasure.

We can easily generate infinite treasure through this particular stax piece using some tech that was alluded to in the Clock of Omens section above; Liquimetal Torque or Mirror of the Forebears

    We first need to get either Liquimetal Torque or Mirror of the Forebears. So in most situations this will require using Magda, Brazen Outlaw's activated ability.
    Next you tutor out Clock of Omens if it is not already on the battlefield.
    Then you use Liquimetal Torque to turn any of your dwarves into an artifact (including Magda) or alternatively activate Mirror of the Forebears to become a copy of any dwarf on the battlefield under your control (including magda).
    Once you have an artifact dwarf on field along with your Clock of Omens you can combo off like you normally would with your Clock of Omens Loop.

From here you will have infinite tapped treasures. You will then either remove the Grafdigger's Cage with something like tutoring Spine of Ish Sah or using a "Draw Loop" to get something like Abrade to hand if you have the mana to cast it (or tutor extra artifacts that generate mana//to be used with Clock of Omens to untap treasures) in order to destroy the Cage which will open up your ability to make infinite untapped treasure (Don't forget to tutor out all your things to make it harder to interact with your casting the destruction spell like God-Pharaoh's Statue and other taxing effects/stax pieces.

Alternatively you can go for some of the more intricate non-creature lines known as "Rube Goldberg" lines and in some cases "Sacrifice Loops" if your deck is running Elixir of Immortality. These lines will be covered later in this guide.

** Artifacts Enter Tapped - Blind Obedience, Root Maze, Dauntless Dismantler (And Other Variants of this Effect)  **

Dauntless Dismantler is being seen in many meta decks just like Blind Obedience has seen a rise in popularity. This type of effect is important to many decks because they want ways to control their opponent's ability to use and abuse treasures. They effectively pseudo shut down many Dockside Extortionist loop variants among other varying combos requiring things to come into play untapped like Underworld Breach lines that include Grinding Station + Mana Vault.

Unfortunately we don't have many ways around this outside of finding a way to remove the piece that is in our way . In many cases if that is Dauntless Dismantler we can be held hostage by it's ability to remove all of our treasures at instant speed, although if they are doing so its being done before we get to make infinite treasures.

The main line for getting around the generic effect of artifacts entering tapped uses Maskwood Nexus and Battered golem. Unlike our clock of omens loop needing at least one untapped treasure to continue looping Battered Golem just needs to be able to untap itself by having an artifact enter, which luckily for us Battered Golem counts itself when it enters like Grinding Station does allowing you to not need any other artifacts to enter after Battered Golem comes into play to begin comboing off.

So in order to deal with artifacts ETBing tapped you need to have Magda, Brazen Outlaw + Maskwood Nexus + Battered Golem + Dwarven Bloodboiler//Any Vehicle.

If you have to tutor for Battered Golem it will enter untapped (just like Grinding Station). So it can immediately be tapped to trigger Magda, Brazen Outlaw to generate a Treasure to untap them again and continue the chain regardless of if the Treasure enters tapped or not. If Battered Golem is on field it should be untapped but if for some reason it is not you can tap any dwarf in any manner to generate a Treasure and allow you to tap Battered Golem to begin a loop.

    Tap Battered Golem to crew Vehicle or activate Dwarven Bloodboiler and to generate a Treasure via Magda, Brazen Outlaw's trigger which will enter tapped due to the STAX effect untapping Battered Golem allowing you to tap them again to generate another treasure...untapping them.
    Make infinite tapped Treasure by continuing the loop in step 1. Tutor for Spine of Ish Sah to destroy the STAX forcing artifacts to enter tapped or continue to step 3 and onwards to make infinite tapped treasures without removing the piece stopping you.
    Tutor out Clock of Omens along with one of the following Cursed Mirror// Mirror of the Forebears//Sculpting Steel. Have Cursed Mirror or Sculpting Steel enter as a copy of Battered Golem or activate Mirror of the Forebears to have it become a copy of Battered Golem untapping the original Battered Golem and the new copy.
    Use Clock of Omen's Ability tapping both Battered Golem targeting a tapped Treasure triggering Magda, Brazen Outlaw twice making two more tapped Treasure and untapping both Battered Golem.
    Repeat step 5 until you have infinite untapped treasure and win the game.

If an opponent is attempting to use Dauntless Dismantler and you already have infinite treasures you can simply tutor out any artifact to reset the normal loop used with Battered Golem in response to the ability and then win over the top as long as you hold priority any time their ability is reached on the stack.

If you want to tech specifically for this situation you can also run Amulet of Vigor in your deck, however its up to personal preference and my opinion is that it's not necessary.

** Artifacts Cannot Be Activated (Karn, Ouphe, Null Rod effects) **

Effects like Collector Ouphe and Null Rod are a lot harder to navigate due to our deck primarily getting it's ability to tap creatures through vehicles. Unfortunately CREW is an activated ability of an artifact and so is the ability on Clock of Omens

This leaves us with one line... which is funnily enough the exact same as when dealing with artifacts ETB tapped however because we cannot use vehicles we must use Dwarven Bloodboiler

So in order to make infinite treasures through Null Rod like effects you do as follows;

    Assemble Magda, Brazen Outlaw + Maskwood Nexus + Battered Golem + Dwarven Bloodboiler
    Tap Battered Golem to use Dwarven Bloodboiler's ability and generate a treasure via Magda, Brazen Outlaw due to Maskwood Nexus making Battered Golem a dwarf. The Treasure will enter untapped and will also untap Battered Golem letting you tap it once more to Dwarven Bloodboiler and continue this loop to generate infinite treasures
    You then have two choices

    To remove the STAX piece stopping you by tutoring Spine of Ish Sah with Magda, Brazen Outlaw's activated ability or alternatively get Professional Face-Breaker and use it's activated ability to turn your infinite Treasure into impulse drawing your deck to then cast something like Abrade or Lightning Bolt depending on the card type of the STAX piece stopping you to enable your win from there. Alternatively you can get Plundering Barbarian out instead by first getting Maskwood Nexus if your list includes him.
    Have a combo that works though these effect types. EX: Terror Of The Peaks combos.

** Alternative Means Of Generating Infinite Untapped Treasures **
Elixir Based Lines - Sacrifice & Rube Goldberg

Sacrifice lines are extremely complicated however they are a way that you can generate infinite untapped treasures through Grafdigger's Cage as many of them do not require additional creatures to do so.

These lines primarily revolve around using Elixir of Immortality and pieces that can be put in the graveyard in some fashion like Lotus Petal//Unlicensed Hearse//Spine of Ish Sah to allow you to continue doing Clock of Omens loops after generating infinite tapped treasures by continually allowing untapped artifacts to be used for the activation of Clock of Omens along side any AD (Normally Mirror of the Forebears or a dwarf that has had Liquimetal Torque used on them).

It can be taken in another direction with the same base concept and abuse the legend rule to force things into the graveyard as well by using things like Mox Amber//Mox Opal//Eriette's Tempting Apple//The One Ring//God-Pharaoh's Statue (essentially all legendary artifacts work) along with Sculpting Steel. You can also abuse the legend rule by using Mirror of the Forebears alongside Cursed Mirror in combination with our commander Magda, Brazen Outlaw.

Because these lines do focus on the graveyard some can still be done including creatures such as Dwarven Scorcher or other creatures that can force themselves or another creatures you control into the graveyard.

The setup/line written for Cursed Mirror in combination with Mirror of the Forebears was written by Irarueland his guide can be found here and I've been given permission to use portions of his guide here. I've kept the rest of the lines in the same writing style for consistency sake.

There are more combinations that can be used other than these listed below however these are the most common and consistent.

The only requirements to make these sorts of loops work is that you essentially have a way to generate the mana or excess treasures to use elixir of immortality to loop whatever choices of artifacts you use that can find their way into the graveyard somehow (either in conjunction with legend rule + sculpting steel or having a way to put itself there like > Sacrifice costs such as Lotus Petal) while still generating excess treasures above that activation cost requirement through crewing a vehicle or using the Clock of Omens activation in conjunction with an artifact dwarf with the artifacts being looped as described in the examples below.

** Eriette's Tempting Apple + Sculpting Steel + Vehicle (ex: Clown Car)//Dwarven Bloodboiler + Lotus Petal **

Setup

    Get to infinite tapped treasures via Clock of Omens loop. This leaves you with one untapped treasure to start.
    Tutor any Vehicle that can be crewed by our artifact dwarf. (For this example we will use High-Speed Hoverbike)
    Tap artifact dwarf to crew High-Speed Hoverbike
    Resolve Magda, Brazen Outlaw trigger creating a Treasure.
    Tutor Eriette's Tempting Apple, on ETB target our artifact dwarf.
    Using Clock of Omens, tap Eriette's Tempting Apple and the artifact dwarf to untap the artifact dwarf.

    Resolve Magda, Brazen Outlaw trigger creating a Treasure.
    Tutor Lotus Petal and sacrifice floating
    Tutor & Activate Elixir of Immortality using the floating and a treasure.
    Sculpting Steel, Lotus Petal and Elixir of Immortality get shuffled into library.
    Repeat this loop netting 1 treasure each loop for infinite untapped treasure.

** Spine of Ish Sah//Lotus Petal + Unlicensed Hearse +Dwarven Scorcher & Maskwood Nexus **

Setup

    Get to infinite tapped treasures via Clock of Omens loop. This leaves you with one untapped treasure to start.
    Tutor Maskwood Nexus

Loop

    Tutor Dwarven Scorcher
    Tutor Spine of Ish Sah ETB targeting itself.
    Before the ETB resolves, using Clock of Omens, tap Spine of Ish Sah and the artifact dwarf to untap the artifact dwarf.
    Resolve Magda, Brazen Outlaw trigger creating a Treasure.
    Resolve both Clock of Omens activation and Spine of Ish Sah ETB.
    Hold priority responding to the Spine of Ish Sah LTB.

    State-based action Unlicensed Hearse dies to having 0 power.
    Use Dwarven Scorcher Ability targeting itself, to sacrifice itself.
    Tutor & Activate Elixir of Immortality using two of the three generated treasures.
    Repeat this loop netting 1 treasure each loop for infinite untapped treasure.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs7t4haz-8w

This line can replace Spine of Ish Sah with Lotus Petal and generate 2 treasures each rotation (clock from hearse + crew from scorcher) and one from using petal each repetition still netting you one extra treasure each loop since one treasure must be used in conjunction with the mana from petal to use Elixir of Immortality

Setup

    Get to infinite tapped treasures via Clock of Omens loop. This leaves you with one untapped treasure to start.
    Tutor Maskwood Nexus

Loop

    Tutor Lotus Petal, Dwarven Scorcher & Unlicensed Hearse
    Tap Unlicensed Hearse and the artifact dwarf to untap the artifact dwarf.
    Resolve Magda, Brazen Outlaw trigger creating a Treasure.
    Before the LTB resolves, using Clock of Omens, tap Unlicensed Hearse and the artifact dwarf to untap the artifact dwarf.
    Use Dwarven Scorcher to crew Unlicensed Hearse
    Resolve Magda, Brazen Outlaw trigger creating a Treasure.
    State-based action Unlicensed Hearse dies to having 0 power.
    Use Dwarven Scorcher Ability targeting itself, to sacrifice itself.
    Use Lotus Petal and sacrifice floating
    Tutor & Activate Elixir of Immortality using one of the two generated treasures and the from petal.
    Repeat this loop netting 1 treasure each loop for infinite untapped treasure.

** Magda, the Hoardmaster + Maskwood Nexus + Vehicle//Dwarven Bloodboiler **

The downside to this line is that it requires you do to it during your own turn since it can only be done at sorcery speed. This variant is specifically to generate infinite treasures to allow you to win at instant speed without going to combat, though this is a win-con itself due to the creatures generated by Magda, the Hoardmaster having haste and can attack that turn.

Setup

    Get to infinite tapped treasures via Clock of Omens loop. This leaves you with one untapped treasure to start.
    Tutor Maskwood Nexus
    Tutor Magda, the Hoardmaster
    Tutor any Vehicle//Dwarven Bloodboiler

Loop

    Sacrifice 3 tapped treasures to use Magda, the Hoardmaster's ability generating a 4/4 red Scorpion Dragon creature token with flying and haste.
    Tap Scorpion Dragon to crew any vehicle or use Dwarven Bloodboiler's ability (this can be done because the dragon is also a dwarf).
    Resolve Magda, Brazen Outlaw trigger creating a Treasure.

** Eriette's Tempting Apple + Sculpting Steel + Goblin Welder - Your Head Judge Might Hate You **

This section is primarily written by Iraruel as well and includes the relevant rules text.

Required for Loop:

    Eriette's Tempting Apple
    Goblin Welder
    Sculpting Steel
    Maskwood Nexus
    Magda, Brazen Outlaw

Starting state discussion:

The starting state for this loop has Goblin Welder, Maskwood Nexus, Magda, Brazen Outlaw on field and one of Eriette's Tempting Apple and Sculpting Steel on field and other in graveyard or hand. Casting it from hand we can copy Eriette's Tempting Apple and legend rule one of them to the graveyard to start the loop from that state.

    Activate Goblin Welder targeting Eriette's Tempting Apple on field and Sculpting Steel in yard to swap.
    Magda, Brazen Outlaw triggers, as Goblin Welder is a dwarf from Maskwood Nexus, creating a treasure.
    Since the swap happens at the same time we make Sculpting Steel enter as a Eriette's Tempting Apple. (See Rules and Combo Tips Section)
    Sculpting Steel copy of Eriette's Tempting Apple triggers as it enters targeting Goblin Welder to untap it giving it haste.
    Repeat generating a treasure each loop.

Notes:

There are some awfully scuffed rulings around this loop as Goblin Welder works in mysterious ways, so if you're running this loop it would be worth keeping note of the relevant rulings found in the Rules and combo tips section, so the inevitable judge call goes a bit more smoothly. The video below discusses the above variant of the combo and another variant that works regardless of how a judge might rule in regards to Sculpting Steel being able to enter as Eriette's Tempting Apple if both are being chosen for Goblin Welder ability with Sculpting Steel being in the graveyard.

** Judge Friendly Variant **

The starting state for this loop has Goblin Welder, Maskwood Nexus, Magda, Brazen Outlaw on field and one of Eriette's Tempting Apple and Sculpting Steel on field and other in graveyard or hand. Casting it from hand we can copy Eriette's Tempting Apple and legend rule one of them to the graveyard to start the loop from that state.

This variant however uses treasures every other repetition when sculpting steel is in the graveyard to circumvent requiring potential judge rulings. If there is a judge called it will be on the part where sculpting steel is entering as a copy of apple, so you can easily pivot to this variant as well in that situation.

Setup

    Tutor//Play Sculpting Steel to field as a copy of Eriette's Tempting Apple putting the Eriette's Tempting Apple in grave
    Activate Goblin Welder targeting Sculpting Steel and Eriette's Tempting Apple
    Magda, Brazen Outlaw triggers, as Goblin Welder is a dwarf from Maskwood Nexus, creating a treasure.
    Eriette's Tempting Apple enters untapping Goblin Welder
    Activate Goblin Welder targeting Treasure and Sculpting Steel in grave
    Sculpting Steel enters as Eriette's Tempting Apple legend ruling the original to the graveyard and untapping Goblin Welder

Loop

    Activate Goblin Welder targeting a Sculpting Steel on field and Eriette's Tempting Apple in grave.
    Magda, Brazen Outlaw triggers, as Goblin Welder is a dwarf from Maskwood Nexus, creating a treasure.
    Eriette's Tempting Apple enters untapping Goblin Welder
    Activate Goblin Welder targeting Treasure and Sculpting Steel in grave
    Magda, Brazen Outlaw triggers, as Goblin Welder is a dwarf from Maskwood Nexus, creating a treasure.
    Sculpting Steel enters as Eriette's Tempting Apple legend ruling the original to the graveyard and untapping Goblin Welder

Important Rules Text Credit to Shodokan from the Magda Discord.

Essentially what happens is that during the resolution of Goblin Welder's ability the game is forced to simultaneously resolve a replacement effect during another event which is not possible as the replacement effect must occur before it can enter and the sacrifice and entering happen simultaneously which is not possible with a replacement effect unresolved.

Because its done simultaneously and instantaneously while a replacement effect is occurring the game relies on rule 616.1e to allow the replacement effect to occur which forces attempts to re-resolve the ability as this clause must happen. So the game state is forced to re-wind slightly and then re-apply with the new information gained from the replacement effect of sculpting steel to allow the ability to fully resolve. This essentially means that while Sculpting Steel is being used in a Goblin Welder swap that when its chosen it just is the thing you want it to be due to how the game forces these interactions to occur as long as Goblin Welder's ability will resolve.

*616.1e Any of the applicable replacement and/or prevention effects may be chosen.*

Referencing 614.12a, if a replacement effect that modifies how a permanent enters the battlefield requires a choice, that choice is made before the permanent enters the battlefield. Hence because the resolution of Goblin Welder's ability with a clone requires a replacement effect to occur it is not possible to complete due to the checks required during replacement effects (see 616), so the replacement effect is completed before it can continue to resolve. The game state must be referenced at the beginning of event 2 in which X artifact is still on board, then after the replacement effect is done you can finish resolution of the ability

There is a big difference between events and SBA checks. Because SBAs won’t be checked in between the events but the board will be able to be referenced by relevant things like clones in between.

614.12. Some replacement effects modify how a permanent enters the battlefield. (See rules 614.1c–d.) Such effects may come from the permanent itself if they affect only that permanent (as opposed to a general subset of permanents that includes it). They may also come from other sources. To determine which replacement effects apply and how they apply, check the characteristics of the permanent as it would exist on the battlefield, taking into account replacement effects that have already modified how it enters the battlefield (see rule 616.1), continuous effects from the permanent’s own static abilities that would apply to it once it’s on the battlefield, and continuous effects that already exist and would apply to the permanent.

** Cloudstone Curio Loops **

Cloudstone Curio loops are simple. Dockside Extortionist is your main line, so as long as dockside makes at least 1 more treasure than the cost of itself and another creature then you can make infinite treasures.

The other way you can use curio is to have Roaming Throne or Xorn on the battlefield as well as a way to tap your creatures such as Dwarven Bloodboiler or any Vehicle. This lets you use two 1 drop creatures to bounce one another infinitely and generate infinite treasures or Magda, Brazen Outlaw and a 1 drop if you hold priority at the correct times.

Example: Dockside + Dwarf (tap outlet optional based on dockside count)

    1 drop variant requires a Dockside Extortionist count of 4 treasures with no Tap Outlet and 3 with a Tap Outlet (if Magda, Brazen Outlaw is on the battlefield)
    2 drop variant requires a Dockside Extortionist count of 5 treasures with no Tap Outlet and 4 with a Tap Outlet (if Magda, Brazen Outlaw is on the battlefield)
    3 drop variant requires a Dockside Extortionist count of 6 treasures with no Tap Outlet and 5 with a Tap Outlet (if Magda, Brazen Outlaw is on the battlefield)

Example using Magda, Brazen Outlaw and no Tap Outlet (2 drops)

Cloudstone Curio and Magda, Brazen Outlaw on the battlefield.

Setup

    Cast Dockside Extortionist triggering Cloudstone Curio letting you bounce Magda, Brazen Outlaw to hand.
    Dockside Extortionist ETBs generating 5 treasures.

Loop

    Cast Magda, Brazen Outlaw using 2 Treasure triggering Cloudstone Curio letting you bounce Dockside Extortionist to hand.
    Cast Dockside Extortionist using 2 Treasure triggering Cloudstone Curio letting you bounce Magda, Brazen Outlaw to hand.

Every time you loop you generate one extra treasure.

Example: Roaming Throne/Xorn + 2x 1 drop + Vehicle

Cloudstone Curio, Roaming Throne//Xorn , Magda, Brazen Outlaw, 2x 1 drops (such as Dwarven Trader and Dwarven Scorcher) and any vehicle (Such as Clown Car) on the battlefield.

Setup

    Cast Dwarven Trader
    Crew Clown Car With Dwarven Trader
    Resolve Magda, Brazen Outlaw trigger creating 2 Treasures due to Roaming Throne//Xorn

Loop

    Cast Dwarven Scorcher using a Treasure triggering Cloudstone Curio bouncing Dwarven Trader to hand.
    Crew Clown Car With Dwarven Scorcher
    Resolve Magda, Brazen Outlaw trigger creating 2 Treasures due to Roaming Throne//Xorn
    Cast Dwarven Trader using a Treasure triggering Cloudstone Curio bouncing Dwarven Scorcher to hand.
    Crew Clown Car With Dwarven Trader
    Resolve Magda, Brazen Outlaw trigger creating 2 Treasures due to Roaming Throne//Xorn

Example: Roaming Throne/Xorn + 1 drop + Magda

Cloudstone Curio, Roaming Throne//Xorn , Magda, Brazen Outlaw and a vehicle(Such as Clown Car//Dwarven Bloodboiler on the battlefield.

Setup

    Cast Dwarven Trader
    Cloudstone Curio trigger goes on the stack to bounce another creature. Hold Priority.
    Crew Clown Car With Dwarven Trader
    Resolve Magda, Brazen Outlaw trigger creating 2 Treasures due to Roaming Throne//Xorn
    Resolve Cloudstone Curio bouncing Magda, Brazen Outlaw to hand.

Loop

    Cast Magda, Brazen Outlaw using 2 Treasure triggering Cloudstone Curio bouncing Dwarven Trader to hand.
    Crew Clown Car With Magda, Brazen Outlaw
    Cast Dwarven Trader
    Cloudstone Curio trigger goes on the stack to bounce another creature. Hold Priority.
    Crew Clown Car With Dwarven Trader
    Resolve Magda, Brazen Outlaw trigger creating 2 Treasures due to Roaming Throne//Xorn
    Resolve Cloudstone Curio bouncing Magda, Brazen Outlaw to hand.
    Crew Clown Car With Dwarven Trader
    Resolve Magda, Brazen Outlaw trigger creating 2 Treasures due to Roaming Throne//Xorn

This loop makes an extra treasure every other loop.

** Rings Of Brighthearth + Basalt Monolith + Treasure Vault **

Rings of Brighthearth lets you copy any ability for 2 mana. So when you use it in conjunction with the untap ability on basalt monolith you end up getting two untaps allowing you to net +1 mana every repetition. From there you simply tutor out Treasure Vault and use the mana to generate pseudo infinite untapped treasures.

This particular line is not used in very many lists however it is used in some lists that have opted to move away from Maskwood Nexus

Setup

Infinite tapped Treasure via some combo like like Clock of Omens and at least 2 mana available.

    Tutor Rings of Brighthearth & Basalt Monolith
    Tap Basalt Monolith for

Loop

    Use Basalt Monolith's ability to untap itself for , hold priority with the activation on the stack and pay to use Rings of Brighthearth allowing you to duplicate the activation of Basalt Monolith
    Resolve Rings of Brighthearth trigger untapping Basalt Monolith, hold priority with the original Basalt Monolith activation on the stack.
    Tap Basalt Monolith generating
    Resolve original Basalt Monolith activation untapping itself.
    Tap Basalt Monolith generating

Once you have done sufficient loops tutor out Treasure Vault and use your pseudo infinite mana to generate as many treasure as you have in your pool. Proceed to win-con of your choice.

** Grinding Station + Clock Of Omens + Artifact Dwarf & Grinding Station + Sculpting Steel + Clock Of Omens + Artifact Dwarf - Wincon In A Box **

Grinding Station untaps itself whenever an artifact comes into play. So this means whenever Magda, Brazen Outlaw triggers the treasure coming into play will untap Grinding Station. Because of this Grinding Station can be used as a transition into untapped treasures or milling your opponents out. If you are under one of the more annoying stax effects where your artifacts ETB tapped (such as Blind Obedience) you can use Sculpting Steel to circumvent the stax effect and get to untapped treasures if you want to win at instant speed or if you want to still use Grinding Station as its own win condition.

Basic Setup

The variant that doesn't need to fight through stax is more of a pseudo win-con than it is a means of generating untapped treasures. Its susceptible to opponents trying to win with things such as Born Upon A Wind + Thassa's Oracle

Clock Of Omens, Magda, Brazen Outlaw and an Artifact Dwarf (Such as Universal Automaton)

Setup

    Get to infinite tapped treasures via Clock of Omens loop. This leaves you with one untapped treasure to start.
    Tutor Grinding Station

Loop

    Restart Clock of Omens loop using Grinding Station and the Universal Automaton
    Resolve Magda, Brazen Outlaw trigger creating a Treasure triggering Grinding Station to untap.

You can then proceed to use your untapped treasures and Universal Automaton to continue the Clock of Omens loop, with each Magda, Brazen Outlaw trigger on the stack you can hold priority and use Grinding Station to mill an opponent for 3 cards, let the Magda trigger resolve which will untap the grinding station allowing you to mill the table.

Fighting Through Artifacts ETB Tapped Stax

Grinding Station Clock Of Omens, Magda, Brazen Outlaw and an Artifact Dwarf (Such as Universal Automaton)

Setup

    Start your Clock of Omens loop by using Grinding Station and your Universal Automaton for Clock of Omens ability.
    Resolve Magda, Brazen Outlaw trigger creating a Treasure triggering Grinding Station to untap.
    Resolve Clock of Omens activation untapping Universal Automaton
    Continue this until you have infinite tapped treasures. Leaving Grinding Station and Universal Automaton untapped.
    Tutor Sculpting Steel, when it enters have it enter as a copy of Grinding Station
    When Sculpting Steel enters as Grinding Station it will untap itself.
    Restart the Clock of Omens combo using your Universal Automaton and one of the two Grinding Stations
    Resolve Magda, Brazen Outlaw trigger creating a Treasure triggering Grinding Station to untap.

Loop

    Tap one Grinding Station and sacrifice a tapped Treasure to mill an opponent for 3.
    Repeat another Clock of Omens activation with the other Grinding Station and your Universal Automaton
    Resolve Magda, Brazen Outlaw trigger creating a Treasure triggering Grinding Station to untap both copies.

Variant 1: Making Infinite Untapped Treasures Through Artifacts ETB Tapped

This line variant is also pretty simple but requires two Grinding Stations and either Roaming Throne or Maskwood Nexus + Xorn

Setup

    Start your Clock of Omens loop by using Grinding Station and your Universal Automaton for Clock of Omens' ability targeting Universal Automaton
    Resolve Magda, Brazen Outlaw trigger creating a Treasure triggering Grinding Station to untap.
    Resolve Clock of Omens activation untapping Universal Automaton
    Continue this until you have infinite tapped treasures. Leaving Grinding Station and Universal Automaton untapped.
    Tutor Sculpting Steel, when it enters have it enter as a copy of Grinding Station
    When Sculpting Steel enters as Grinding Station it will untap itself.
    Tutor Roaming Throne or Maskwood Nexus + Xorn

Loop

    Activate Clock of Omens using your Universal Automaton and one of the two Grinding Stations targeting Universal Automaton. This will result in two Magda, Brazen Outlaw triggers.
    Resolve the first Magda, Brazen Outlaw trigger creating a Treasure and triggering Grinding Station to untap. Hold priority with the second trigger on the stack.
    Activate Clock of Omens by using both copies of Grinding Station to untap a treasure.
    Resolve second Magda, Brazen Outlaw trigger creating a Treasure and triggering Grinding Station to untap.
    Resolve Clock of Omens activation untapping your Universal Automaton

Variant 2: Making Infinite Untapped Treasures Through Artifacts ETB Tapped

This line variant is also pretty simple but requires two Grinding Stations and two artifact dwarves such as Adaptive Automaton and Universal Automaton

Setup

    Start your Clock of Omens loop by using Grinding Station and your Universal Automaton for Clock of Omens' ability targeting Universal Automaton
    Resolve Magda, Brazen Outlaw trigger creating a Treasure triggering Grinding Station to untap.
    Resolve Clock of Omens activation untapping Universal Automaton
    Continue this until you have infinite tapped treasures. Leaving Grinding Station and Universal Automaton untapped.
    Tutor Sculpting Steel, when it enters have it enter as a copy of Grinding Station
    When Sculpting Steel enters as Grinding Station it will untap itself.
    Tutor second Artifact Dwarf such as Adaptive Automaton

Loop

    Activate Clock of Omens using your Universal Automaton and Adaptive Automaton targeting your Universal Automaton. This will result in two Magda, Brazen Outlaw triggers.
    Hold priority with both Magda triggers on the stack and activate Clock of Omens using both Grinding Station to untap a Treasure
    Resolve the first Magda, Brazen Outlaw trigger creating a Treasure triggering both Grinding Station to untap.
    Hold priority with Magda's trigger on the stack and activate Clock of Omens using both Grinding Station to untap Adaptive Automaton
    Resolve Clock of Omens activation untapping your Adaptive Automaton
    Resolve Clock of Omens activation untapping your Universal Automaton

** Attack Of The Clones - Xorn // Roaming Throne // Academy Manufactor Lines **
Roaming Throne and Clones

This particular section is written by Irarule and covers the lines with Roaming Throne, Xorn and Academy Manufactor along with the ways to copy them such as Mirror of the Forebears Sculpting Steel Cursed Mirror and The Mycosynth Gardens

Roaming Throne illustrated by Cristi Balanescu.

This section explores several combos and combinations using Roaming Throne, Xorn and/or Academy Manufactor alongside clone effects like Cursed Mirror, Sculpting Steel and/or The Mycosynth Gardens to greatly increase treasure generated per instance. The first combination is using Roaming Throne and Xorn to increase the treasure generated from Magda, Brazen Outlaw's tap clause, causing each trigger to make an additional treasure with Xorn's replacement effect and also increasing the number of triggers by 1 using Roaming Throne's replacement effect to make 4 treasures per tapped dwarf. By cloning either part of this combo, e.g. 2 Roaming Throne and 1 Xorn, we get 6 treasures per tap allowing us to tutor for more clones to generate even more treasure per tapped dwarf! From this point we can tutor Maskwood Nexus to allow us to tutor Dwarven Scorcher, which alongside Elixir of Immortality, allows us to tap Dwarven Scorcher to generate an absorbent amount of treasure then sacrifice it to shuffle it back with Elixir of Immortality, which will generate infinite treasures.

We can also use Academy Manufactor in a similar but different way requiring it to be cloned to stack it's replacement effect. With 2 copies of Academy Manufactor for example, every treasure generated will create 3 Food, clue and Treasure. This is possible as Academy Manufactor ability is a replacement effect which will replace each time one of a Food, Clue or Treasure is generated with one of each tokens. With 2 of these effects we are first replacing the initial Treasure with a Food, Clue and Treasure, then again replacing those with a Food, Clue and Treasure. That means for each additional Academy Manufactor we're generating an exponential amount of Food, Clue and Treasure, e.g. 3 Academy Manufactor makes 9 of each, and 4 make 27 of each, this can be modelled by 3^(A-1) where A is the number of Academy Manufactor when more than 1.

The previously mentioned Xorn and Roaming Throne also can be used here with 2 Academy Manufactor effects. Xorn in this case will increase the number of generated by a factor of (X+1) where X is the number of Xorn, e.g. 1 Xorn and 2 Academy Manufactor generate 6 of each token, this gives us the formula (X+1)*3^(A-1) for the number of treasure generated when using at least one Xorn (X number of Xorn) and at least two Academy Manufactor (A number of Academy Manufactor). This is because of Xorn being another replacement effect allowing you to first apply it before the Academy Manufactor replacement effects. Using Roaming Throne in this case is much simpler as it just increasing the number of triggers Magda, Brazen Outlaw makes rather than being a replacement effect, and ends up generating the same formula as the Xorn case.

These combinations can then be used in the same way as the Roaming Throne and Xorn combination above to generate infinite treasures the same way. After generating infinite treasure this way we then need to use one of the outlets found in the outlet section, examples of these are looping Eriette's Tempting Apple with Elixir of Immortality or Goblin Welder.

Xorn and Roaming Throne example line:

Xorn illustrated by Yigit Koroglu.

Setup pieces:

    Untapped Magda, Brazen Outlaw.
    A vehicle (e.g. Clown Car)
    Untapped Xorn
    5 treasures for a Magda, Brazen Outlaw activation.

Loop requires:

    Roaming Throne
    Maskwood Nexus
    Elixir of Immortality

Any 2 of these copy effects:

    Cursed Mirror
    Mirror of the Forebears
    Sculpting Steel
    The Mycosynth Gardens
    Flipped Fable of the Mirror-Breaker

Loop as follows:

    Tutor Roaming Throne entering as a dwarf.
    Crew Clown Car tapping Magda, Brazen Outlaw and Roaming Throne.
    Magda, Brazen Outlaw triggers 4 times, 4 Xorn replacement effects makes 2 treasures 4 times.
    Tutor Sculpting Steel to field copying Roaming Throne.
    Crew Clown Car tapping the copy of Roaming Throne.
    Magda, Brazen Outlaw triggers 3 times, 3 Xorn replacement effects makes 2 treasures 3 times.
    Tutor Maskwood Nexus to field.
    Crew Clown Car tapping Xorn.
    Magda, Brazen Outlaw triggers 3 times, 3 Xorn replacement effects makes 2 treasures 3 times.
    Tutor Cursed Mirror to field copying Xorn.
    Crew Clown Car tapping the copy of Xorn.
    Magda, Brazen Outlaw triggers 3 times, 6 Xorn replacement effects makes 3 treasures 3 times.

Loop begins here:

    Tutor a saccable creature to field (e.g. Dwarven Scorcher, Bogardan Hellkite targeting itself with the ETB...).
    Crew Clown Car tapping the saccable creature.
    Magda, Brazen Outlaw triggers 3 times, 6 Xorn replacement effects makes 3 treasures 3 times.
    Sacrifice the creature.
    Repeat for many saccable creatures netting treasures.
    Tutor Elixir of Immortality to field.
    Active Elixir of Immortality shuffling the saccable creatures back into your library.
    Repeat to generate infinite treasures.
    Loop wincon

Alternative "Loop" - No Elixir

    Tutor any creature.
    Crew Clown Car
    Magda, Brazen Outlaw triggers 3 times, 6 Xorn replacement effects makes 3 treasures 3 times.

Repeat loop until you have enough extra treasures to either remove multiple stax pieces stopping another line or you have enough treasures to win the game in some way.

If you have 20 creatures in library this generates 180 treasures and gets you all of your creatures which should be more than enough to dig your way out of any board state.

This video is an overview of how the copy functionality works and the moving pieces in regards to the differences in some board states, copying RT vs Xorn and the impact that may have on your lines.

The video example is better suited to explain non-elixir lines.

Important Combo Adjacent Info

There are some things that are important to understand when trying to win the game. There are going to be stax pieces such as Grafdigger's Cage and Null Rod that can prevent some win attempts from varying Magda, Brazen Outlaw lists. Most lists tend to run their own copy of Grafdigger's Cage as this card is effective against many strategies such as shutting down Underworld Breach lines. The lists running Grafdigger's Cage either need ways to win through it or ways to remove it. The same goes for Null Rod specifically where some Magda lists are on this since mana rocks are such an integral part of EDH and many artifact activated abilities can help propel our opponents ahead even if its only by gaining mana through Treasure.

The most important thing to understand are the pieces we have that can remove things that are stopping us and the conditions by which you might look to go for specific lines. Most of these lines consist of ways to draw your deck until you find the proper interaction to remove whatever is stopping you such as Abrade which can not only remove artifacts but can also remove some creatures that may get in the way of your win attempts such as Manglehorn and Collector Ouphe

Many decks will run the monored Reclamation Sage in our handy Plundering Barbarian as a means of not only allowing us to remove artifacts when played from hand but also potentially tutorable in conjunction with Maskwood Nexus to let us remove our own Null Rod should we find outself in that position.

Some decks also run Spine of Ish Sah as a catch-all tutorable means of removing any problematic permanent. The only way this is turned off is if someone artifact ETBs are not able to trigger due to things such as Elesh Norn, Mother Of Machines or Doorkeeper Thrull are on the field. Some lists opt to not run this however as they question it's card quality which is also a valid opinion.

Otherwise we can use the following means of digging for answers
Professional Face-Breaker - "Card Draw" through null rod

As this is a creature we cannot tutor this through Grafdigger's Cage

Professional Face-Breaker lets us use our infinite treasures to impulse draw our deck.

Normally this consists of first tutoring any artifacts and or dragons we can to the field that will not impede casting whatever we need to find in order to remove the piece stopping us from winning. This also can mean every creature in our deck as long as we first grab Maskwood Nexus. This is meant to help preserve win lines so that you do not end up exiling things you'd use to win and end up not being able to play them for whatever reason.

Then you can proceed to impulse draw until you hit the interaction you need to remove the problematic piece. Sometimes this can require multiple steps like fist removing Null Rod to enable artifact abilities which allows something like Liquimetal Torque to make anything an opponent has into an artifact, this then allows another of your shatters to remove something potentially forcing your artifact to enter tapped such as Blind Obedience or simply remove something that is still somehow stopping you from making infinite untapped treasures which can then be used for mana based or clock based win conditions.

Draw Loops With The One Ring - Clock Of Omens, Goblin Welder and Elixir Of Immortality Variants

The One Ring is an incredibly powerful card that acts as a way for you to draw through your deck if you have a way to either untap it (Clock Of Omens) or replace it with a copy of itself (Sculpting Steel) which lets you proceed find anything needed to remove a problematic piece.

These lines require an activated ability of an artifact though so they do not work through Null Rod type effects.

Clock of Omens Only Variant

This particular variant is risky because you need to be very precise about the amount of cards in your library so you do not risk drawing yourself out.

Normally you will tutor out anything you can before doing this loop to limit the amount of cards you may need to draw to find your out.

Setup

    Generate Infinite untapped treasures.
    Tutor Clock of Omens (if not on field) & The One ring

Loop

    Tap The One Ring adding a burden counter, Draw X where X is the amount of burden counters on The One Ring
    Tap 2x Treasure to activate Clock of Omens targeting The One ring untapping it.
    Untap The One Ring

Repeat until you find your out(s) and cast them. After doing this you may use Sculpting Steel having it enter as a copy of The One Ring to reset your burden counters when you sacrifice the original The One Ring to the legend rule.

Welder & Clock Of Omens Variant

Does not work through Grafdigger's Cage unless you initially have welder on field. It also pre-supposes you have made infinite untapped treasures via something like Battered Golem + Maskwood Nexus

This particular variant is if you wish to draw one card at a time so that you can not risk any funny business from your opponents.

Setup

    Obtain infinite untapped treasures.
    Tutor Goblin Welder, The One Ring & Clock of Omens
    Tutor Liquimetal Torque or Mirror of the Forebears naming goblin (or dwarf if you have maskwood out).
    Use Liquimetal Torque or activate Mirror of the Forebears to become Goblin Welder
    Tutor Cursed Mirror, enter as a copy of artifact Goblin Welder
    Tap The One ring to draw one card.
    Tutor Sculpting Steel entering as a copy of The One Ring. Legend rule sacrificing the original copy to the graveyard.

Loop

    Tap Cursed Mirror copy of Goblin Welder to activate it's ability targeting The One ring and a Sculpting Steel
    Resolve Goblin Welder ability.
    Tap The One Ring to draw a card
    Use 2x untapped Treasure to activate Clock of Omens targeting Cursed Mirror copy of Goblin Welder untapping it.
    Tap Cursed Mirror copy of Goblin Welder to activate it's ability targeting Sculpting Steel and a Treasure
    Sculpting Steel enters as a copy of The One Ring. Legend rule sacrificing the original copy to the graveyard.
    Use 2x untapped Treasure to activate Clock of Omens targeting Cursed Mirror copy of Goblin Welder untapping it.

Repeat loop until you've found your out(s).

Elixir Of Immortality

Setup

    Obtain infinite untapped treasures.
    Tutor Elixir Of Immortality & The One Ring
    Tap The One Ring to draw a card
    Tutor Sculpting Steel entering as a copy of The One Ring. Legend rule sacrificing the original copy to the graveyard.

Loop

    Tap Sculpting Steel to draw a card
    Activate Elixir Of Immortality shuffling both itself and The One Ring back into your library
    Tutor Elixir Of Immortality & The One Ring
    The One Ring enters. Legend rule sacrificing the Sculpting Steel copy to the graveyard.
    Tap The One Ring to draw a card.
    Activate Elixir Of Immortality shuffling both itself and Sculpting Steel back into your library.
    Tutor Elixir of Immortality & Sculpting Steel
    Sculpting Steel entering as a copy of The One Ring. Legend rule sacrificing the original copy to the graveyard.

Repeat loop until you've found your out(s).

Pyrite Spellbomb//Soul-Guide Lantern//Stone Of Erech Draw Loop

While these loops are normally not used unless it is a budget variant of the deck there are some pilots that still use Pyrite Spellbomb as a win condition.

For every example below I will be using Pyrite Spellbomb however Pyrite Spellbomb Soul-Guide Lantern & Stone of Erech all function the same way in that if you can get them from graveyard to the battlefield repeatedly then you can use infinite mana to draw your deck.

Elixir Of Immortality Loop

Setup

    Generate infinite untapped treasure

Loop

    Tutor Pyrite Spellbomb & Elixir Of Immortality
    Activate Pyrite Spellbomb to draw a card
    Activate Elixir of Immortality shuffling both itself and Pyrite Spellbomb into your library.

Repeat loop until you've found your out(s).

Goblin Welder Loop

Setup

    Obtain infinite untapped treasures.
    Tutor Goblin Welder, Clock of Omens & Pyrite Spellbomb
    Tutor Liquimetal Torque or Mirror of the Forebears naming goblin (or dwarf if you have maskwood out).
    Use Liquimetal Torque or activate Mirror of the Forebears to become Goblin Welder
    Tutor Cursed Mirror, enter as a copy of artifact Goblin Welder
    Activate Pyrite Spellbomb to draw a card

Loop

    Tap Cursed Mirror copy of Goblin Welder to activate it's ability targeting Pyrite Spellbomb and Treasure
    Resolve Goblin Welder ability.
    Activate Pyrite Spellbomb to draw a card
    Use 2x untapped Treasure to activate Clock of Omens targeting Cursed Mirror copy of Goblin Welder untapping it.

Repeat loop until you've found your out(s).

Goblin Engineer Loop

Setup

    Obtain infinite untapped treasures.
    Tutor Goblin Engineer putting Pyrite Spellbomb in graveyard and Clock of Omens
    Tutor Liquimetal Torque or Mirror of the Forebears naming goblin (or dwarf if you have maskwood out).
    Use Liquimetal Torque or activate Mirror of the Forebears to become Goblin Engineer
    Tutor Cursed Mirror, enter as a copy of artifact Goblin Engineer

Loop

    Activate Cursed Mirror copy of Goblin Engineer to activate it's ability targeting Pyrite Spellbomb and Treasure
    Resolve Goblin Engineer ability.
    Activate Pyrite Spellbomb to draw a card
    Use 2x untapped Treasure to activate Clock of Omens targeting Cursed Mirror copy of Goblin Engineer to untap it.

Repeat loop until you've found your out(s).

Removing Enchantments & Non-Artifact Problem Permanents

When you have access to your draw loops you can use this to your advantage to allow for another important interaction.

Every deck runs Liquimetal Torque since it is a way to let you do Clock of Omens combo with Magda, Brazen Outlaw as your only dwarf on field and it just so happens to win through Grafdigger's Cage. Some decks also run Liquimetal Coating as well if they want more ways to have "artifact dwarves," which normally means turbo lists though less decklists even for turbo tend to be running it these days.

So instead of using Liquimetal Torque in order to combo off we're going to use it to remove that annoying Blind Obedience or whatever else your other interaction might not deal with.

The basic premise is simple, use Liquimetal Torque targeting the thing that is stopping your win to make it into an artifact. In most cases this is going to be an enchantment since our other interaction deals with creatures and artifacts. This however will allow us to use our shatters (artifact removal) to get rid of the thing you've just turned into an artifact with Liquimetal Torque.

This turns our shatter spells into catch all removal just like Spine of Ish Sah.

If you are under Blind Obedience like effects you'll have to use your infinite untapped treasures in conjunction with the ability of Clock of Omens to untap your Liquimetal Torque to enable this line of play.
Welding Away Your Own Null Rod - Goblin Welder & Goblin Engineer

This requires Goblin Welder or Goblin Engineer that has haste either from Cursed Mirror or Eriette's Tempting Apple. Normally this also requires tutoring Maskwood Nexus to enable the tutor for the Goblin Welder or Goblin Engineer

Once you have a goblin in play that can use it's ability make sure you have an artifact in the graveyard that can be traded for it if it is Goblin Welder otherwise Goblin Engineer puts one there for you.

If you need an artifact in yard for the welder variant then simply tutor any legendary artifact such as The One Ring and then tutor Sculpting Steel entering as a copy of the legendary artifact. Legend rule either to the graveyard.

Protecting Your Win

There are times your opponents may try to interact with you and normally the best time to do that is with magda's trigger on the stack when trying to combo off.

If you have the spare untapped artifacts or the treasures in order to use the ability of Magda, Brazen Outlaw to tutor more untapped artifacts to field you can protect yourself with Clock of Omens

The most simple way you can protect your win is by activating Magda, Brazen Outlaw again and continuing your combo on top of your own activation, or using that activation to help restart your combo. The only way this is not possible is with Trickbind or any other interaction with split second such as Sudden Shock

Otherwise you basically you can put as many Clock of Omens activations on the stack on top of their interaction attempt in order to allow you to still combo off over the top of this attempt at interacting. This is why interaction is essentially futile against a Magda that has infinite tapped treasures since they can just get extra untapped artifacts to allow them to restart their combo.

When an opponent interacts at the point where the Magda treasure trigger is on the stack which is before the initial resolution of the Clock of Omens activation that untaps your artifact dwarf you will have to get three untapped artifacts in order to attempt to restart your combo. This is because it takes one Clock of Omens activation to untap your artifact dwarf and then another untapped artifact to be used in conjunction with your artifact dwarf to restart your Clock of Omens combo. Interaction attempts are normally something people do to attempt to stop you on your first attempt to start your Clock Of Omens combo or they are silly and attempt it when you are trying to restart your combo after generating infinite tapped treasures and getting Roaming Throne or Maskwood Nexus and Xorn.

Some pilots are opting to use Battered Golem lines more often since as long as you have a non-zero board state there should be ways to force extra interaction. For every untapped dwarf you have when you start the line you have a second win attempt forcing another interaction attempt from your opponents which is a lot less of a requirement in many cases than the three artifacts you need for each interaction attempt when trying to combo off with Clock of Omens

Angel's Grace & The One Ring Protection

Angel's Grace is a card that lets an opponent attempt to save themselves from losing the game by preventing them from going below 1 life from taking damage.

The One Ring also causes opponents to gain protection from everything which can be quite annoying to deal with.

Fortunately there are a few ways we can cause loss of life which gets through this effect; God-Pharaoh's Statue and Eriette's Tempting Apple

Eriette's Tempting Apple cannot be used to win through The One Ring since you cannot target the opponent. However if an opponent tries to use Angel's Grace any loop that uses Eriette's Tempting Apple can take the opponent to zero life which when the turn ends Angel's Grace will fall off at a point in the cleanup step before state based actions would be checked such as player life total and the opponent will lose the game for being at 0 life at the first opportunity the game can check state based things.

The One Ring combo can only be done during our turn as it requires our end step to trigger God-Pharaoh's Statue to allow a combo with Dualcaster Mage and Return The Favor using the God-Pharaoh's Statue trigger during end step. If you want more information on this combo line check the Dualcaster Mage section.

Another way through Angel's Grace requires running equipment. If you are on something like Lightning Greaves you can have Cursed Mirror copy any creature and then attach Lightning Greaves to them. Then you will pass to end step. During cleanup the Cursed Mirror and Angel's Grace will both have their "until end of turn" aspects of the card complete at the same time which will cause the Lightning Greaves to unattach from the Cursed Mirror and force a new round of priority to happen allowing you to combo off at a time you normally cannot take game actions. This has been confirmed with a L5 Judge.

Thanks to Rust_ITG for getting all of this stuff straightened out and confirmed rules wise.
Combo "Enders" - Winning The Game

There are A LOT of ways you can go about winning the game with Magda, Brazen Outlaw

There are many packages of cards that work in conjunction with one another to allow you to win games in a variety of ways. Some catalysts are things such as Elixir of Immortality, Goblin Welder, Realm-Scorcher Hellkite, Eriette's Tempting Apple, Terror of the Peaks and Tel-Jilad Stylus

Win types include everything from life loss, damage to face at instant speed, combat damage and even potentially milling out our opponents.

Most of the deck variants only use a few card packages to secure wins while trying to have tools that allow wins through varying stax pieces. This is done by either having means of winning through problematic pieces or ways to remove what is stopping you being able to win.

One important thing to remember is that just because a line is easier to explain to your opponents does not make it any better or worth having over other potentially more complex lines that use pieces that are already in the deck for other reasons. This is especially true if a piece being added to your deck is only being added to further that goal of making your win easier to explain.

All combo lines will assume that Magda, Brazen Outlaw is on field and you're able to generate infinite treasures in some way.
Basic Outlets

These types of outlets tend to be avoided in many of the current iterations of Magda. The reason for this is that these types of outlets serve no real purpose outside of being a way to end the game and the only thing that these types of win conditions provide is simplicity and in a way help shortcut/shorten your line.

Some of the cards discussed can certainly have some secondary value but it's heavily dependent on the archetype you're looking to pilot.
Realm-Scorcher Hellkite & Skarrgan Hellkite

Realm-Scorcher Hellkite was essentially a strictly better version of Skarrgan Hellkite so its why Skarrgan is not seen much as they are actually essentially the same price. Sometimes Skarrgan gets played because it costs 1 less mana to play however it's ability costs more per activation.

Realm-Scorcher Hellkite and Skarrgan Hellkite both serve the exact same purpose in lists that run it. They acts as a way to end the game by dumping infinite mana into infinite activations of their abilities.
After you have generated infinite untapped treasures for infinite mana you will do as follows;

    Tutor Realm-Scorcher Hellkite or Skarrgan Hellkite (Choose counter for RIOT so Skaargan can be activated)
    Activate Realm-Scorcher Hellkite or Skarrgan Hellkite to targeting an opponent with the ability.
    Hold priority and continue to put an infinite amount of activations on the stack while holding priority after each activation.
    Let all activations resolve and kill your opponents.

The reason you hold priority is that your your opponents cannot use anything to interact or prevent the win. This includes things with split second like Trickbind and V.A.T.S.

The downside to these lines however is that you cannot win by tutoring out creatures with a Grafdigger's Cage in play. You are required to find a way to remove it if you wish to use this type of wincon.

Grinding Station

This win-con is normally paired with Memory Jar which is a reason that a majority of the lists you might see do not run this as a win condition. If you don't have a way to make your opponents draw and end the game at instant speed while they have no library then you're forced to make your opponents draw in order to win which against some decks can be a risk. While decks like The Gitrog Monster are not common there are decks run multiple ways to shuffle their graveyard into their deck such as how Gitrog uses the "Shuffle Titans" as part of their own combo line protection.

This particular line is very simple;

Setup

    Generate infinite treasures.
    Tutor Grinding Station

Loop

    Tap Grinding Station to mill an opponent for 3.
    Restart any combo used to generate treasures causing a Magda, Brazen Outlaw trigger.
    Magda, Brazen Outlaw trigger resolves and untaps Grinding Station allowing you to tap it again.

Finish Variant 1

    Repeat loop until all opponents have 0 cards in library.
    Pass to opponents and let them lose one by one at their draw step.

Finish Variant 2 -Repeat loop until all opponents have 0 cards in library.

    Tutor Memory Jar
    Activate Memory Jar forcing opponents to draw.
    Opponents will lose the game when attempting to draw with no cards in their library.

ETB Loops/Outlets

The ETB loops listed here are specific to the creatures that use OTHER creatures entering to do damage. This means that other means of dealing damage through ETB effects such as Knight Paladin, Twinshot Sniper, Legion Extruder and Bogardan Hellkite are not discussed here.

Terror Of The Peaks & Scourge of Valkas are the two main outlets that will be discussed. Both of these creatures are similar because they rely on Maskwood Nexus in order to allow access to all creatures in your deck since most decks are not on many dragons.
Terror Of The Peaks

Terror of The Peaks is an interesting creature since it allows you to get the trigger from any creature ETBing. An important part of this is that it relies on the power of the creatures entering meaning that if anything modifies their power before the trigger resolves it will end up dealing more damage than the base power listed on the creature.

Because this combo requires Maskwood Nexus creatures that increase the power of your dwarves such as Magda, Brazen Ourlaw, Adaptive Automaton, Metallic Mimic are incredibly potent in regards to helping you end the game with the least amount of tutors without reliance on being able to recur creatures that can sacrifice themselves like Dwarven Scorcher.

This also means that Dwarven Bloodboiler allows you to ETB creatures and tap themselves to it's ability in order to increase their power by 2.

Because the ETB effect is so important the ability to copy triggers or the Terror of the Peaks itself is very important. The introduction of Roaming Throne makes these lines a lot cleaner since even if you have it enter and choose dwarf earlier in the game to combo off to make your treasures when it is combined with Maskwood Nexus it allows you to multiply the triggers by the amount of Roaming Throne on field. So while we can turn Terror of The Peaks into an artifact and make a copy of it with things such as Sculpting Steel that same Sculpting Steel can be used on Roaming Throne to get the same effect of multiple triggers. This also lets the Roaming Throne + Xorn copy lines become a more potent way to transition into winning with Terror of The Peaks since you normally end up with three Roaming Throne in most cases which lets Terror of The Peaks trigger four times and lowers the amount of creatures that need to be tutored by a large margin.

One of the most important aspects of this combo line is that if you find yourself able to make infinite treasures through effects such as Null Rod or Stony Silence you can turn that into a win without needing to remove the piece that prevents artifacts from being activated.

With infinite treasures Magda, the Hoardmaster wins alone in conjunction with Terror of The Peaks

Because there are a few variants of this combo we're going to explain the different variants

We will assume you need to deal 120 damage to kill the table.

Variant 1: Dwarven Bloodboiler

Setup

    Generate infinite treasures (tapped or untapped does not matter)
    Tutor Maskwood Nexus, Roaming Throne (if not on field already) & Terror of The Peaks
    Tutor Adaptive Automaton choosing Dwarf and Dwarven Bloodboiler to field. Hold Priority with Terror of The Peaks trigger on the stack.
    Hold Priority on the Terror of The Peaks ETB Triggers.
    Tap Dwarven Bloodboiler to it's own ability giving it +2/0. Hold Priority.
    Tap Terror Of The Peaks to Dwarven Bloodboiler ability to give Dwarven Bloodboiler +2/0. Hold Priority.
    Tap Adaptive Automaton to Dwarven Bloodboiler ability to give Dwarven Bloodboiler +2/0,
    Resolve Terror Of The Peaks ETB triggers dealing 10 damage to any target twice. (+1/0 from Magda, +1/1 from Adaptive Automaton and +6/0 from two Bloodboiler activations) for Dwarven Bloodboiler ETB and 2 damage to any target from Adaptive Automaton ETB twice. Total 4 damage.

Finish

    Tutor your remaining creatures to field tapping them all to activate Dwarven Bloodboiler and give themselves +2/0.

This means every 1/1 turns into a 5/1 so each creature allows you to deal a minimum of 10 damage due to having a minimum of two Terror of The Peaks triggers per creature that enters. This requires 10 more creatures to ETB and go through the same process to win the game.

Variant 2: Three or More Triggers Per ETB

Setup

    Generate infinite treasures (tapped or untapped does not matter)
    Tutor Maskwood Nexus, Roaming Throne (if not on field already) & Terror of The Peaks
    Tutor two or more of the following to the field Sculpting Steel Mirror of the Forebears Cursed Mirror entering/becoming either Roaming Throne or Terror Of The Peaks. Hold priority on the Terror of The Peaks trigger between each tutor/copy.
    Resolve 9 total Terror of The Peaks ETB triggers (2 for first clone, 3 for second clone, 4 for third clone). Dealing 45 total damage.

Finish

    Tutor creature to field putting 5x Terror of The Peaks ETB triggers on the stack dealing a minimum of 10 total damage per creature that enters.

Magda buffs all creatures by +1/0 so 1/1s would deal 10 damage, 2/2s would deal 15 damage etc, This means a minimum of 7 creatures need to be tutored to win.

Variant 3: Combining Variant 1 and 2 - Most Damage Per ETB

    Generate infinite treasures (tapped or untapped does not matter)
    Tutor Maskwood Nexus, Roaming Throne (if not on field already) & Terror of The Peaks
    Tutor two or more of the following to the field Sculpting Steel Mirror of the Forebears Cursed Mirror entering/becoming either Roaming Throne or Terror Of The Peaks. Hold priority on the Terror of The Peaks trigger between each tutor/copy.
    Tutor Adaptive Automaton choosing Dwarf and Dwarven Bloodboiler to field. Hold Priority with Terror of The Peaks trigger on the stack.
    Tap Dwarven Bloodboiler to it's own ability giving it +2/0. Hold Priority.
    Tap Terror Of The Peaks to Dwarven Bloodboiler ability to give Dwarven Bloodboiler +2/0. Hold Priority.
    Tap Adaptive Automaton to Dwarven Bloodboiler ability to give Dwarven Bloodboiler +2/0, Hold Priority.
    Tap 4x Roaming Throne to Dwarven Bloodboiler ability to give Dwarven Bloodboiler +8/0. Hold Priority
    Resolve 5x Terror of The Peaks ETB trigger for Adaptive Automaton for 2 damage five times. 10 damage total.
    Resolve 5x Terror of The Peaks ETB trigger for Dwarven Bloodboiler for 18 damage five times. 90 damage total.
    Resolve 9 total Terror of The Peaks ETB triggers for Roaming Throne clones (2 for first clone, 3 for second clone, 4 for third clone). 45 damage total.

All opponents should be dead since you've dealt 145 damage. If for some reason an opponent is alive then tutor another creature to field and use Dwarven Bloodboiler to buff it and deal another 25 damage minimum per creature.

Variant 4: Maskwood Nexus & Clock Of Omens Only

The downside to this particular variant is that it cannot win through either Grafdigger's Cage or Null Rod type effects.

Setup

    Generate infinite treasures (tapped or untapped does not matter).
    Tutor Maskwood Nexus, Terror of The Peaks & Clock of Omens (if it is not on field).
    Use 3x Treasure to activate Maskwood Nexus generating a 2/2 Shapeshifter.
    Resolve Terror of the Peaks dealing 3 damage to any target.
    Activate Clock of Omens targeting Maskwood Nexus by using 2x Tresure to untap Maskwood Nexus untapping it.

Loop

    Use 3x Treasure to activate Maskwood Nexus generating a 2/2 Shapeshifter.
    Resolve Terror of the Peaks dealing 3 damage to any target.
    Activate Clock of Omens targeting Maskwood Nexus by using 2x Tresure to untap Maskwood Nexus untapping it.

Scourge of Valkas

Scourge Of Valkas is a similar win condition to Terror of The Peaks as they both rely on Maskwood Nexus in order to tutor every creature in your deck.

Scourge of Valkas however deals damage equal to the amount of dragons currently on the battlefield rather than based on the creature's power that is entering.

This makes Scourge of Valkas quite a bit simpler to end games with since the line is a bit more streamlined requiring less math when done optimally.

We will assume you need to deal 120 damage to kill the table.

Variant 1: No Extra Triggers

Setup

    Generate infinite treasures (tapped or untapped does not matter)
    Tutor Maskwood Nexus & Scourge of Valkas
    Tutor any creature to field. Deal a minimum of 3 damage to any target (Magda, Valkas, New Creature)
    Tutor any creature to field. Deal a minimum of 4 damage to any target.

Finish

    Tutor every creature in your deck to field. You must tutor at least 15 creatures to field to kill your opponents if you only need to deal 120 damage.

Variant 2: Extra Triggers

Setup

    Generate infinite treasures (tapped or untapped does not matter)
    Tutor Maskwood Nexus & Scourge of Valkas
    Tutor Roaming Throne . Deal a minimum of 3 damage to any target (Magda, Valkas, New Creature)
    Tutor Sculpting Steel as a copy of Roaming Throne. Deal 8 damage to any target.
    Tutor Cursed Mirror as a copy of Roaming Throne or Scourge Of Vaalkas. Deal 15 damage to any target.
    Tutor any creature to field. Deal 24 damage to any target.

Finish

    Tutor as many creatures as necessary to kill your opponents.

With this setup it should take 3 or less tutors if your opponents' life in total is equal to 120.

Variant 3: Maskwood Nexus + Clock Of Omens Only

The downside to this particular variant is that it cannot win through either Grafdigger's Cage or Null Rod type effects.

Setup

    Generate infinite treasures (tapped or untapped does not matter).
    Tutor Maskwood Nexus, Scourge Of Valkas & Clock of Omens (if it is not on field).
    Use 3x Treasure to activate Maskwood Nexus generating a 2/2 Shapeshifter.
    Resolve Scourge Of Valkas dealing 3 damage to any target.
    Activate Clock of Omens targeting Maskwood Nexus by using 2x Tresure to untap Maskwood Nexus untapping it.

Loop

    Use 3x Treasure to activate Maskwood Nexus generating a 2/2 Shapeshifter.
    Resolve Scourge Of Valkas dealing X damage to any target where X is equal to the amount of creatures on the battlefield.
    Activate Clock of Omens targeting Maskwood Nexus by using 2x Tresure to untap Maskwood Nexus untapping it.

Elixir Of Immortality Outlets

Elixir of Immortality is a potent engine for ending the game at instant speed since not only it's ability is able to be done at any time you have priority but so is the ability to tutor with Magda, Brazen Outlaw. This allows cards that go to the graveyard to be put back into your deck and be tutored by Magda, Brazen Outlaw again enabling some interesting loops.
Eriette's Tempting Apple & Pyrite Spellbomb

These outlets are artifacts and because of this win lines that use Elixir of Immortality as a catalyst to generating infinite treasures through Grafdigger's Cage can then be transitioned into wins as neither Eriette's Tempting Apple or Pyrite Spellbomb are creatures and when interacting with the graveyard you are shuffling them back into your library and not casting them.

Eriette's Tempting Apple is an artifact that has an ability where you can pay and and sacrifice it in order to cause an opponent to lose 3 life.

Pyrite Spellbomb is an artifact that has an ability where you can pay and sacrifice it to deal 2 damage to any target.

Because both of these artifacts end up in the graveyard after using their abilities Elixir of Immortality can then be used to place itself and either Eriette's Tempting Apple or Pyrite Spellbomb back into your library to be tutored once more with our commander.

Setup

    Make Infinite Untapped Treasures which can be used for infinite mana of any color.
    Tutor Eriette's Tempting Apple or Pyrite Spellbomb & Elixir of Immortality

Loop

    Pay Either or to activate either Eriette's Tempting Apple or Pyrite Spellbomb causing it to be sacrificed and go to the graveyard.
    Resolve the ability to cause an opponent to lose 3 life or take 2 damage depending on artifact used.
    Activate Elixir of Immortality shuffling your graveyard and itself into your library.
    Retutor Eriette's Tempting Apple or Pyrite Spellbomb & Elixir of Immortality

Repeat this loop until all opponents have been eliminated.

Maskwood Nexus + Elixir - Terror Of The Peaks & Scourge of Valkas

Because this is a creature based combo that uses activations of artifacts it cannot win through either Grafdigger's Cage or Null Rod effects.

Both Terror of The Peaks and Scourge of Valkas have interactions with Elixir of Immortality due to Maskwood Nexus making every creature into a dragon.

This lets you use creatures that can be sacrificed such as Dwarven Scorcher Enslaved Dwarf and Liberated Dwarf in combination with Elixir of Immortality to have infinite amounts of creature ETBs if you are somehow forced to win without Clock of Omens and cannot simply generate infinite 2/2 Shapeshifters by constantly activating Maskwood Nexus and untapping it with Clock of Omens.

Setup

    Make infinite treasures
    Tutor Maskwood Nexus if not on field and either Terror of The Peaks or Scourge of Valkas
    Tutor any creature with a sacrifice ability to field. Dwarven Scorcher can be done with tapped treasure lines where as Enslaved Dwarf Liberated Dwarf require untapped treasure due to having a sacrifice cost of
    ETB triggers Terror of The Peaks or Scourge of Valkas

Loop

    Sacrifice your loopable creature such as Dwarven Scorcher to put it in the graveyard.
    Tutor Elixir of Immortality & Activate it.
    Resolve Elixir of Immortality and shuffle your loopable creature and Elixir of Immortality into your library
    Tutor your loopable creature & Elixir Of Immortality
    ETB triggers Terror of The Peaks or Scourge of Valkas

Repeat loop until all opponents are eliminated.
Elixir Of Immortality Draw > Damage Loops

We have many ways to deal damage that are loopable when combined with any means of infinitely drawing and Elixir of Immortality to be able to force them back into your library to be re-drawn and replayed.

Primarily these are going to be spells such as Lightning Bolt, Galvanic Blast or any other instant that will deal damage to any target. The problem however with these cards for ending some lines is that if an opponent has a means of forcing one spell per turn such as Rule of Law then you cannot win with them. The only way around this is by using Twinshot Sniper and it's channel ability since abilities are not considered spells and can still be done an infinite amount of times per turn unless someone happens to have Trickbind.

You can do the loop using any means of drawing your deck that requires going to the graveyard in some way such as Pyrite Spellbomb//Stone of Erech//Soul-Guide Lantern or The One Ring & Sculpting Steel.

The One Ring + Sculpting Steel

Setup

    Perform Elixir of Immortality + The One Ring + Sculpting Steel loop outlined in the section above until you have drawn your entire deck leaving Elixir of Immortality and The One Ring on field.

If necessary do an extra loop without drawing to replace Sculpting Steel with The One Ring to generate this board state. This is unnecessary if you understand the loop but it will be used here to set a defined loop.

Loop

    Cast Lightning Bolt or channel Twinshot Sniper
    Activate Elixir of Immortality shuffling itself, Sculpting Steel and Lightning Bolt//Twinshot Sniper back into your library
    Tutor Elixir of immortality & Sculpting Steel entering as a copy of The One Ring. Legend rule sacrificing the original copy to the graveyard.
    Tap Sculpting Steel to draw Lightning Bolt or Twinshot Sniper
    Cast Lightning Bolt or channel Twinshot Sniper
    Activate Elixir of Immortality shuffling itself, The One Ring and Lightning Bolt//Twinshot Sniper back into your library
    Tutor Elixir of Immortality & The One Ring. Legend rule sacrificing the Sculpting Steel] copy to the graveyard.
    Tap The One Ring to draw Lightning Bolt or Twinshot Sniper

Repeat until all opponents are eliminated.

Pyrite Spellbomb//Stone of Erech//Soul-Guide Lantern

For this variant we will be using Pyrite Spellbomb even though both Stone of Erech and Soul-Guide Lantern function identically.

Setup

    Perform Elixir of Immortality + Pyrite Spellbomb draw loop outlined in the above section until you have drawn your entire deck leaving Elixir of Immortality and Pyrite Spellbomb on the battlefield.
    Cast Lightning bolt or channel Twinshot Sniper
    Activate Elixir of Immortality to shuffle itself and Lightning Bolt or Twinshot Sniper into your library.
    Tutor Elixir of Immortality
    Activate Pyrite Spellbomb to draw Lightning Bolt or Twinshot Sniper
    Cast Lightning bolt or channel Twinshot Sniper

Loop

    Activate Elixir of Immortality to shuffle itself, Pyrite Spellbomb and Lightning Bolt or Twinshot Sniper into your library.
    Tutor Elixir of Immortality & Pyrite Spellbomb
    Activate Pyrite Spellbomb to draw Lightning Bolt or Twinshot Sniper
    Cast Lightning bolt or channel Twinshot Sniper

Repeat until all opponents are eliminated.

Tel-Jilad Stylus Outlets

All stylus outlets are contingent on using Clock of Omens as a way to continually untap your Tel-Jilad Stylus to put whatever it is you are comboing off with back into your deck.

It also requires infinite untapped treasures since you are reliant on Clock of Omens and due to this reliance you cannot do these lines through Nullrod type effects.
Twinshot Sniper //Terror Of The Peaks//Scourge of Valkas//Bogardan Hellkite - Creature Based Lines

The thing all of these have in common is that they require creatures to function.

This means that not only do these lines not work through Null Rod Effects but they don't work through Grafdigger's Cage either.

All of these creatures have something in common as well is that they all have ETB effects, either their own ETB effect in Twinshot Sniper and Bogardan Hellkite or when another creature enters the battlefield for Terror of The Peaks and Scourge of Valkas

Twinshot Sniper//Bogardan Hellkite Variant

Setup

    Obtain infinite untapped treasures
    Tutor Tel-Jilad Stylyus and Clock of Omens (if it is not on field already)

Loop

    Tutor Twinshot sniper or Bogardan Hellkite and resolve their ETB dealing damage to any target.
    Activate Tel-Jilad Stylus putting Twinshot Sniper or Bogardan Hellkite back into your library.
    Tap two Treasure to activate Clock of Omens targeting Tel-Jilad Stylus
    Resolve Clock of Omens untapping Tel-Jilad Stylus

Repeat loop until all opponents are eliminated.

Terror of the Peaks//Scourge of Valkas

Setup

    Obtain infinite untapped treasures
    Tutor Tel-Jilad Stylyus and Clock of Omens (if it is not on field already)
    Tutor Maskwood Nexus and Terror Of The Peaks or Scourge of Valkas

Loop

    Tutor any other creature and resolve the Terror of The Peaks//Scourge of Valkas ETB dealing damage to any target.
    Activate Tel-Jilad Stylus putting the creature you chose back into your deck.
    Tap two Treasure to activate Clock of Omens targeting Tel-Jilad Stylus
    Resolve Clock of Omens untapping Tel-Jilad Stylus

Repeat loop until all opponents are eliminated.

Spine of Ish Sah//Legion Extruder//Knight Paladin - Artifact Based Lines

Legion Extruder//Knight Paladin

The Legion Extruder//Knight Paladin line works exactly the same as the Twinshot Sniper//Bogardan Hellkite line outlined in the previous section however it does win through Grafdigger's Cage unlike the creature variants.

Since both Legion Extruder and Knight Paladin function exactly the same we are going to use Legion Extruder for our example.

Setup

    Obtain infinite untapped treasures
    Tutor Tel-Jilad Stylyus and Clock of Omens (if it is not on field already)

Loop

    Tutor Legion Extruder and resolve their ETB dealing damage to any target.
    Activate Tel-Jilad Stylus putting Legion Extruder back in your library.
    Tap two Treasure to activate Clock of Omens targeting Tel-Jilad Stylus
    Resolve Clock of Omens untapping Tel-Jilad Stylus

Repeat loop until all opponents are eliminated.

Spine of Ish Sah

Spine of Ish Sah when looped for repeated ETBs makes it so your opponents are left with no permanents with every permanent you have in your deck on field.

This line works through both Null Rod type effects and Grafdigger's Cage due to the fact that not only is it an artifact which means allows you to play around Grafdigger's Cage but it allows you to have Null Rod or any similar effect be the first target when it's tutored so the only thing that stops you would be things like Elesh Norn, Mother Of Machines and Doorkeeper Thrull.

That being said if you wish to play through those Null Rod style effects you have to generate infinite untapped treasures in a way without Clock of Omens.

This line is not normally used unless you specifically do not have an instant speed win available to you at the time, though if your opponents don't concede with no permanents they are masocists.

Setup

    Obtain infinite untapped treasures
    Tutor Tel-Jilad Stylyus and Clock of Omens (if it is not on field already)
    Tutor Spine of Ish Sah targeting any permanent an opponent controls to destroy it. Null Rod type effects are your first target.

Loop

    Activate Tel-Jilad Stylus putting Spine of Ish Sah back in your library.
    Tap two Treasure to activate Clock of Omens targeting Tel-Jilad Stylus
    Resolve Clock of Omens untapping Tel-Jilad Stylus
    Tutor Spine of Ish Sah targeting any permananent an opponent controls to destroy it.

Loop until all permanents of opponents are destroyed. Then proceed to tutor your entire deck and win during the following turn cycle.

Stylus The One Ring Draw Loop

This line is here for if your deck is not on Spine of Ish Sah as a way to remove Grafdigger's Cage and enable your creature based ETB wins. Though why a Stylus list would not be on Spine boggles my mind.

Since Stylus is so underplayed I felt this draw loop was better suited to be put here instead of in the section about combo adjacent information.

Setup

    Obtain infinite untapped treasures
    Tutor Tel-Jilad Stylyus, The One Ring and Clock of Omens (if it is not on field already)

Loop

    Tap The One Ring to draw a card
    Tap Tel-Jilad Stylus targeting The One ring
    Tap two Treasure to activate Clock of Omens targeting Tel-Jilad Stylus
    Resolve Clock of Omens untapping Tel-Jilad Stylus
    Tutor The One Ring

Finish

    Find the shatter you need to remove Grafdigger's Cage and then do the Twinshot Sniper loop listed in the above section.

Maskwood Nexus & Magda, the Hoardmaster - Combat Damage Wins

Since Maskwood Nexus is used in many other win conditions its important to understand the difference between using it as a wincon itself and using it to enable another line such as the damge based ETB lines for Terror of the Peaks and Scourge of Valkas

The main difference between Maskwood Nexus and Magda, The Hoardmaster is that Magda can only generate the creatures you're going to use to win on your own turn. The upside however is that you don't have to jump through any hoops to give those creatures haste like you do for the Maskwood Nexus line.

Magda, The Hoardmaster

This line does not win through Grafdigger's Cage but does squeak through Null Rod type effects.

Setup

    Obtain infinite treasures
    Tutor Maskwood Nexus
    Tutor Magda, The Hoardmaster now that it is considered a dragon.

Loop

During Main Phase 1

    Activate Magda, The Hoardmaster
    Hold Priority on the activation

Continue loop until you have pseudo infinite Scorpion Dragon on the stack and then let everything resolve. The reason you hold priority is that so your opponents cannot interact and stop your win even with something like Trickbind

Maskwood Nexus

This line specifically requires Axgard Cavalry as it allows you to give the tokens that Maskwood Nexus generates haste.

Setup

    Obtain infinite untapped treasures.
    Tutor Maskwood Nexus & Clock of Omens (if not on field)
    Tutor Axgard Cavalry
    Tutor Liquimetal Torque or Mirror of the Forebears naming Dwarf
    Use Liquimetal Torque or activate Mirror of the Forebears to become Axgard Cavalry
    Tutor Cursed Mirror, enter as a copy of artifact Axgard Cavalry

Loop

    Activate Maskwood Nexus generating a 2/2 Shapeshifter
    Tap Cursed Mirror copy of Axgard Cavalry to give the 2/2 Shapeshifter haste.
    Tap two Treasure to Activate Clock of Omens targeting Maskwood Nexus to untap it.
    Tap two Treasure to Activate Clock of Omens targeting Cursed Mirror copy of Axgard Cavalry to untap it.

Continue until you have infinite hastey creatures and attack for the win.

Engineer & Welder Loops (Damage & Destruction)

Goblin Welder and Goblin Engineer both allow you to win with infinite ETBs. It functions in the same manner as Tel-Jilad Stylus essentially allowing you to win with the same sort of permanents.

Similarly it requires Clock of Omens and being made into an artifact to function for all loop variants other than Eriette's Tempting Apple.

The different win conditions consist of; Eriette's Tempting Apple, Twinshot Sniper, Legion Extruder, Terror of The Peaks, Scourge of Valkas and Spine of Ish Sah
Eriette's Tempting Apple

This line assumes you are not on Elixir of Immortality but are on Maskwood Nexus and Goblin Welder.

Goblin Engineer does not work since Eriette's Tempting Apple is legendary and if you try to circumvent this with Sculpting Steel it will not work since you cannot activate it's ability in response to the legend rule as it is a state based action.

Setup

    Obtain infinite treasures.
    Tutor Maskwood Nexus
    Tutor Goblin Welder
    Tutor Eriette's Tempting Apple ETB targeting Goblin Welder to give it haste.

Loop

    Activate and sacrifice Eriette's Tempting Apple causing an opponent to lose 3 life.
    Activate Goblin Welder with Treasure & Eriette's Tempting Apple as targets.
    Eriette's Tempting Apple ETB targeting Goblin Welder to untap it.

Twinshot Sniper//Legion Extruder

Both of these function in the same way.

We'll be using Twinshot Sniper for these examples

So for anything in this section just replace Twinshot Sniper with Legion Extruder. The major difference however is that if you already have Goblin Welder or Goblin Engineer on field the extruder line works through Grafdigger's Cage

Goblin Welder

Setup

    Obtain infinite untapped treasures.
    Tutor Maskwood Nexus & Clock of Omens (if not on field already).
    Tutor Goblin Welder
    Tutor Liquimetal Torque or Mirror of the Forebears naming goblin (or dwarf if you have maskwood out).
    Activate Liquimetal Torque targeting Goblin Welder or activate Mirror of the Forebears to become Goblin Welder
    Tutor Cursed Mirror, enter as a copy of artifact Goblin Welder
    Tutor Twinshot Sniper ETB deal 2 damage to any target.
    Tutor any artifact that can remove itself from play; Spine of Ish Sah, Lotus Petal, Jeweled Lotus or Sculpting Steel
    Activate Lotus Petal//Jeweled Lotus to add mana and put it in the graveyard. Alternatively resolve the fist half of the Spine of Ish Sah ETB targeting itself putting it in the graveyard, hold priority on the trigger to put it to hand.

Loop (Lotus Petal//Jeweled Lotus Version)

    Activate Cursed Mirror copy of Goblin Welder targeting Twinshot Sniper and Lotus Petal
    Tap 2x Treasure to activate Clock of Omens targeting Cursed Mirror copy of Goblin Welder to untap it.
    Activate Cursed Mirror copy of Goblin Welder targeting Twinshot Sniper and Lotus Petal
    Twinshot Sniper ETB deal 2 damage to any target.
    Tap 2x Treasure to activate Clock of Omens targeting Cursed Mirror copy of Goblin Welder to untap it.

Repeat until all opponents are eliminated

Loop (Spine of Ish Sah)

    Activate Cursed Mirror copy of Goblin Welder targeting Twinshot Sniper and Spine of Ish Sah
    Spine of Ish Sah ETB targeting itself. Hold Priority.
    Tap 2x Treasure to activate Clock of Omens targeting Cursed Mirror copy of Goblin Welder to untap it.
    Activate Cursed Mirror copy of Goblin Welder targeting Spine of Ish Sah and Twinshot Sniper
    ResolveTwinshot Sniper ETB deal 2 damage to any target. Hold priority on Spine of Ish Sah LTB trigger. Since these happen simultaneously you can layer the stack how you wish.
    Tap 2x Treasure to activate Clock of Omens targeting Cursed Mirror copy of Goblin Welder to untap it.

Goblin Engineer

Setup

    Obtain infinite untapped treasures.
    Tutor Maskwood Nexus & Clock of Omens (if not on field already).
    Tutor Goblin Engineer ETB put any CMC 3 or less artifact in graveyard. (We'll use Jeweled Lotus in our example here)
    Tutor Liquimetal Torque or Mirror of the Forebears naming goblin (or dwarf if you have maskwood out).
    Activate Liquimetal Torque targeting Goblin Welder or activate Mirror of the Forebears to become Goblin Engineer
    Tutor Cursed Mirror, enter as a copy of artifact Goblin Engineer
    Tutor Twinshot Sniper ETB deal 2 damage to any target.
    Tutor Sculpting Steel as a copy of Twinshot Sniper ETB deal 2 damage to any target.

Loop

    Activate Cursed Mirror copy of Goblin Engineer targeting Jeweled Lotus and Sculpting Steel.
    Tap 2x Treasure to activate Clock of Omens targeting Cursed Mirror copy of Goblin Welder to untap it.
    Activate Cursed Mirror copy of Goblin Engineer targeting Sculpting Steel and Jeweled Lotus.
    Sculpting Steel enters as a copy of Twinshot Sniper ETB 2 damage to any target.
    Tap 2x Treasure to activate Clock of Omens targeting Cursed Mirror copy of Goblin Welder to untap it.

Spine of Ish Sah

For this version you can use either Goblin Welder or Goblin Engineer, the only difference is that you can skip a tutor step by putting something 3CMC or less into the GY and using that instead of the listed Lotus Petal//Jeweled Lotus when using engineer.

The reason both variants function exactly the same way is because sculpting steel streamlines things a bit more easily though for a welder specific variant you can skip the Sculpting Steel and just use the Lotus Petal//Jeweled Lotus and the Spine of Ish Sah, just be careful when spine LTB goes on the stack.

Welder Variant

Setup

    Obtain infinite untapped treasures.
    Tutor Maskwood Nexus & Clock of Omens (if not on field already).
    Tutor Goblin Welder
    Tutor Liquimetal Torque or Mirror of the Forebears naming goblin (or dwarf if you have maskwood out).
    Activate Liquimetal Torque targeting Goblin Welder or activate Mirror of the Forebears to become Goblin Welder
    Tutor Cursed Mirror, enter as a copy of artifact Goblin Welder
    Tutor any artifact that can remove itself from play; Such as [Lotus Petal, Jeweled Lotus
    Tutor Spine of Ish Sah ETB targeting an opponent's permanent.
    Tutor Sculpting Steel as a copy of Spine of Ish Sah ETB targeting an opponent's permanent. (This step is unnecessary if using welder, you can just use the original spine to go in and out)

Loop

    Activate Cursed Mirror copy of Goblin Welder targeting Jeweled Lotus and Sculpting Steel.
    Hold priority on Sculpting Steel copy of Spine of Ish Sah LTB.
    Tap 2x Treasure to activate Clock of Omens targeting Cursed Mirror copy of Goblin Welder to untap it.
    Activate Cursed Mirror copy of Goblin Welder targeting Sculpting Steel and Jeweled Lotus.
    Sculpting Steel enters as a copy of Spine of Ish Sah ETB targeting an opponent's permanent.

Loop until all permanents of opponents are destroyed. Then proceed to tutor your entire deck and win during the following turn cycle.

If using Spine of Ish Sah instead of Sculpting Steel for the welder variant just follow the same steps but replace Sculpting Steel with Spine of Ish Sah

Video below showcases NOT using Sculpting Steel for the welder variant, just Spine of Ish Sah

Engineer Variant

Setup

    Obtain infinite untapped treasures.
    Tutor Maskwood Nexus & Clock of Omens (if not on field already).

Terror Of The Peaks & Scourge of Valkas

For this version you can use either Goblin Welder or Goblin Engineer, the only difference is that you can skip a tutor step by putting something 3CMC or less into the GY and using that instead of the listed Lotus Petal//Jeweled Lotus when using engineer. All artifact creatures we run really other than Roaming Throne are 3cmc or less so they can all be chosen by engineer.

While this variant does exist its likely unnecessary since the baseline variant is "stronger" but its nice to have options.

Setup

    Obtain infinite untapped treasures.
    Tutor Maskwood Nexus & Clock of Omens (if not on field already).
    Tutor Goblin Welder
    Tutor Liquimetal Torque or Mirror of the Forebears naming goblin (or dwarf if you have maskwood out).

    Tutor Cursed Mirror, enter as a copy of artifact Goblin Welder
    Tutor any artifact that can remove itself from play; Such as Lotus Petal, Jeweled Lotus
    Activate Lotus Petal//Jeweled Lotus to add mana and put it in the graveyard.
    Tutor Terror of The Peaks or Scourge of Valkas (Both cause ETB damage and all creatures that enter will be dragons since Maskwood Nexus is in play).
    Tutor any Artifact Creature such as Universal Automaton. ETB deal damage to any target.

Loop

    Activate Cursed Mirror copy of Goblin Welder targeting Jeweled Lotus and Universal Automaton (Artifact Creature).
    Tap 2x Treasure to activate Clock of Omens targeting Cursed Mirror copy of Goblin Welder to untap it.
    Activate Cursed Mirror copy of Goblin Welder targeting Universal Automaton (Artifact Creature) and Jeweled Lotus. ETB deal damage to any target.

Dualcaster Mage

We all know the basic line of using a copy spell like Twinflame//Heat Shimmer//Molten Duplication on one of your creatures, holding priority and casting Dualcaster Mage however magda can make for some really interesting lines with dualcaster especially in conjunction with the new card Return The Favor.

Lines curtesy of Rust_ITG
Dualcaster + Roaming Throne +Copy Spell + Bolt

Setup

    Tutor Roaming Throne naming Human (or anything if you have Maskwood Nexus out).

    Tutor Dualcaster Mage

Dualcaster + Sculpting Steel + Welder/Engineer - Burn & Life Loss Variants

Goblin Engineer and Goblin Welder both work for this line as the thing you are swapping in and out is only 3 cmc, Sculpting Steel

The life loss variant wins through the protection caused by the casting of The One Ring. You cannot target an opponent to cause loss of life however the end step trigger from God Pharaoh's Statue does not target and can still cause life loss through the protection.

Staple Cards & Pseudo Staples

These lists were agreed upon by a few notable pilots in the Open Hands CEDH community. There is ALWAYS room for interpretation and these types of things will almost always be opinion based so take it with a grain of salt.
Staples

Creatures

    Dockside Extortionist - This card needs no explanation, treasures = good.
    Magda, The Hoardmaster - Treasure generator for doing what some variants of the deck do best… interact and target things to do so. Infinite treasure outlet that also functions as a way to just get an army of beaters over time for stax variants.
    Plundering Barbarian - Mono-Red Reclamation Sage, our only way to force remove Null Rod if not on Spine of Ish Sah. This card also happens to be modal with the other option giving us acceleration.
    Professional Face-Breaker - Not only does this let us get value from attacking into board states where we can but it acts as a way to get a draw loop through Null Rod
    Roaming Throne - Doubles Magda Triggers which bridges the gap easily between tapped and untapped treasures for our Clock of Omens loop. Also happens to be an artifact dwarf so its a 1 card combo with Clock of Omens
    Universal Automaton - 1 drop artifact dwarf.

Spells

    Abrade - Modal artifact or creature removal for most of the things that stop us outside of some things with higher toughness such as Yasharn, Implacable Earth and Linvala, Keeper of Silence
    Bottle-Cap Blast - Interaction and treasure generator that lets us use our spare artifacts to help pay for the cost.
    Deflecting Swat - One of the few ways we can protect our commander when targeted and is great stack interaction.
    Galvanic Blast - 4 damage just for having three artifacts which is more often than not.
    Lightning Bolt - 3 damage red for 1… Red’s staple burn card since forever.
    Return The Favor - The floor for this card is copying a card draw or treasure trigger and the ceiling is winning the game. It's a 3 cost fork, way to tutor with an opponent’s Ranger-Captain Of Eos or one of the stronger options in being a way to get a second Magda activation.

Artifacts

    Clock of Omens - Our most notable combo line.
    Clown Car - 0 drop vehicle that can provide creatures in mid game that may be dwarves when Maskwood Nexus is on field.
    Cursed Mirror - THE copy creature artifact. Lets you copy an opponent’s Dockside Exortionist or any other creature of your choice. It is also a means of giving haste to creatures we use to combo off such as Goblin Welder. Very important part of some of the copy lines with Roaming Throne and Xorn
    God-Pharaoh's Statue - Asymmetrical stax piece that makes a lot of lines harder or impossible for many decks.
    High-Speed Hoverbike//Smuggler's Copter - 2 drop vehicles that either give us the ability to loot or can act as a means of generating surprise treasures or stopping that pesky 20/20 orc from swinging at your face.
    Liquimetal Torque - Mana rock that lets us make any dwarf into an artifact or any non-land permanent an opponent controls into an artifact to be destroyed. Also acts as a way to potentially combo through Grafdigger's Cage
    Mana Crypt
    Mox Opal - We are almost always generating enough treasures for this to be on and with most lists being between 25 and 35 artifacts our main gameplan tends to turn this on baseline.
    Portal To Phyrexia - Many decks don’t flood the board with creatures so this lets you remove important pieces from your opponent’s board state while giving you the ability to reanimate something every turn with access to all player’s graveyards.
    Sculpting Steel - Combo piece and just a strong clone effect that lets us copy anything.
    Sol Ring
    SpringLeaf Drum - Mana acceleration that lets us tap dwarves to generate treasure.
    The One Ring - Draw engine that can also act as a combo engine.
    Unlicensed Hearse - Graveyard hate is something we’re light on, this also acts as a combo piece in some specific lines. It can also force blocks from opponents as if you use its ability a few times you’re able to swing with a 6/6 which is a decent clock.

Land

    Ancient Tomb - Life as a resource for mana acceleration.
    Cavern of Souls - Uncounterable dwarves.
    Holdout Settlement - Way to generate treasures without a vehicle.
    Mutavault - Dwarf body on a land.
    Survivors' Encampment - Way to generate treasures without a vehicle.
    Treasure Vault - Turn extra mana into treasures.
    Urza's Saga - Go get your Universal Automaton. Sol Ring, Mana Crypt, Grafdigger’s Cage or other important 0/1 drops.
    Volatile Fault - Essentially this is a Wasteland that generates you a treasure when used against a majority of 4+ color decks as they aren’t normally on basic lands.

Pseudo Staples

Creatures

    Axgard Cavalry - This creature taps itself which generates treasures while also providing a way to give other creatures haste which can be quite important in some combo lines using Maskwood Nexus or Goblin Welder
    Adaptive Automaton - Artifact Dwarf that makes it harder to block our dwarves and makes Orcish Bowmaster work a bit harder to remove our dwarves.
    Magus Of The Moon - 4+ color decks are on next to no basics... or none... which limits their options substantially. Harder to counter than it's enchantment counterpart.
    Xorn - Non-Dwarf way to help generate extra treasures. This is a replacement effect so when combined with something like Roaming Throne it will make each trigger generate 2 treasures. Unfortunately requires Maskwood Nexus in order to be tutored with our commander.

Artifacts

    Damping Sphere - Shuts down lands that make more than one mana such as Gaea's Cradle while also making it potentially difficult for some decks to combo off especially decks that "Storm Off" or cast a lot of spells during their combos.
    Grafdigger's Cage - Important way to stop to field tutors and abilitiys such as Winota, Joiner of Forces, most green tutors and notable shuts down casting things from grave which stops many lines such as Underworld Breach
    Mana Vault - Mana acceleration when you need it most. A lot of variants of the deck end up in a "Draw > Go" play patern so this can get uptapped more often than you'd think and it gives us acces to casting our 4+ CMC artifacts much earlier.
    Maskwood Nexus - Allows us to tutor out any creatures from our deck with our commander and is a potential combo outlet to make infinite creatures.
    Mirror of the Forebears - This is a creature copy spell that also makes whatever you're copying an artifact in addition to what it's other types. Also acts as a way to potentially combo off through Grafdigger's Cage
    Spine of Ish Sah - Catch all removal piece that can help dig out of very deep holes especially in combination with Sculpting Steel. It is also a combo piece that lets you remove all of your opponent's permanents.
    Tangle Wire - Stax piece that acts as a pseudo vehicle letting you tap your dwarves. Strong resource denial in early game and when combined with things like Winter Orb can be back breaking.
    Torpor Orb - Shuts down Dockside Extortionist loops and Thassa's Oracle wins.

Spells

    Jeska's Will - Way to generate quite a bit of mana in many situations to help accelerate gameplan while also giving you access to some potential impulse draw. Downside is that the impulse draw portion is shut off by Drannith Magistrate

Enchantments

    Blood Moon - 4+ color decks are on next to no basics... or none... which limits their options substantially. This is the enchantment counterpart to Magus Of The Moon

Lands

    Barbarian Ring - Threshold helps you deal with problematic permanents.
    Command Beacon - Gives us a way to avoid command tax when Magda has been killed multiple times
    Great Furnace - Artifact that is tutorable by our commander and also something that can be exchanged in some situations with Goblin Welder or Goblin Engineer
    Hammerheim - Next to no downside and has profitable interaction with Magda, The Hoardmaster and Phantasmal Image
    The Mycosynth Gardens - Land that acts as a way to copy artifacts. Its floor is still high as this would turn into something like a Mana Crypt while it's ceiling is making a copy of something like Roaming Throne
    Shinka, The Bloodsoaked Keep - This is a way to help deter blockers and help opponents get through or surprisingly help remove a problematic creature another opponent unwisely blocked with. Also has profitable interaction with Magda, The Hoardmaster and Phantasmal Image
    Sokenzan, Crucible of Defiance - Generates two bodies that can be dwarves with Maskwood Nexus that generates red baseline.

Card//Combo Packages; How They Interact & Reasoning To Potentially Play Them (WIP)

This section will be explaining the functionality of some specific cards as well as the reasoning behind why it may be in some decks, the cards that go along with one another and how those sets of cards overlapping effects deckbuilding.

Something being a package card does not mean that it needs to be there with ALL other cards that can be packaged with it, just that it has specific use cases in conjunction with the base card. These cards may have individual use cases outside of the reasoning it'd be packaged with any given base card.

There are some exceptions to the rule where sometimes cards are seldom seen without one another.

It is being written elsewhere and being ported over. The current format is not set in stone.

Example;
Elixir Of Immortality "Package"

Base Card

Elixir Of Immortality

This card is used primarily as tool to facilitate ending the game through various combos enders. It also acts as a catalyst for generating infinite treasures given specific board states (such as fighting through Grafdigger's Cage) and a means of generically recurring things that have gone into the graveyard that you wish to have access to. At worst it is an extra artifact to help protect your Clock of Omens combo.

Package Cards

    Eriette's Tempting Apple - Primarily used as an infinite mana outlet in conjunction with Elixir Of Immortality to cause life loss to opponents until they are dead.
    Jeweled Lotus - Used in a few specific lines for generating infinite treasures through Grafdigger's Cage
    Lotus Petal - Used in a few specific lines for generating infinite treasures through Grafdigger's Cage
    Mirror Of The Forebears - This card functions as a way to help with specific lines to facilitate making infinite treasures through Grafdigger's Cage, normally part of the "Rube Goldberg" lines. Many times you need a "new" dwarf that happens to be an artifact to continue your combo with Clock of Omens as your others are tapped and using Liquimetal Torque would not allow you to start your combo.
    Pyrite Spellbomb - Primarily used as an infinite mana outlet in conjunction with Elixir Of Immortality to deal damage to opponents until they are dead. Also can be used as a way to draw your deck through recurring it with Elixir of Immortality
    Sculpting Steel - A card that allows you to copy any artifact, this is very useful when trying to do specific combos that look to leverage the Legend Rule for making infinite treasures, drawing your deck or winning the game.
    Soul-Guide Lantern//Stone of Erech - While they have some inherent value these are primarily used as draw loops to facilitate wins with burn spells or Twinshot Sniper
    Spine of Ish Sah - The primary usecase for this is as removal to unlock the activated ability of Elixir of Immortality when something is preventing activations like Null Rod. Also functions as a way to combo and remove all of your opponent's permanents. Additionally it is used in some lines that generate infinite treasures through Grafdigger's Cage.
    The One Ring - This card functions as a draw loop with Elixir of Immortality and Sculpting Steel along with just being a baseline busted card. These draw loops can allow you to win the game with burn spells or Twinshot Sniper. This also can be used in some lines to make infinite treasures through Grafdigger's Cage.
    Twinshot Sniper - Combo ender for any draw loop with Elixir of Immortality to allow wins through Rule of Law effects.
    Unlicensed Hearse - Used in a few specific lines for generating infinite treasures through Grafdigger's Cage

Example Package Used In Actual Deck

Elixir of Immortality + Jeweled Lotus + Lotus Petal + Mirror of The Forebears + Sculpting Steel + The One Ring + Twinshot Sniper + Unlicensed Hearse

Cards here being added to a deck that are not already considered "Staples" are Elixir of Immortality, Lotus Petal, Jeweled Lotus, Mirror of the Forebears and Twinshot Sniper

This type of package provides a means of recursion, mana acceleration, multiple ways to generate infinite untapped treasures through Grafdigger's Cage, a draw loop to help dig you out of problems and provide a combo ender that wins through Rule of Law effects.

Twinshot Sniper is not required as you can end your draw loops with burn such as Lightning Bolt. However the ability to win through Rule of Law effects and the fact that it wins in conjunction with other lines adds extra value and redundancy which means its normally seen in this sort of package of cards.

Tertiary/Potential Overlap Card Example

Eriette's Tempting Apple

This card may be important when running a secondary package including Goblin Welder and or Goblin Engineer to have redundancy in the ability to give haste to target creature as there is often times situations where Cursed Mirror get used on other things, however Elixir of Immortality gives a different path to obtaining this if you have a means of consistently destroying your Cursed Mirror, putting it back in your deck and then re-tutoring it. So while it provides some overlap it may be unnecessary and may only provide a simplified line to win through Grafdigger's Cage.

Why Might You Avoid This Card/Package Type

If you are on other card packages such as Goblin Welder, Goblin Engineer and the cards that go along with it you may not value the recursion as much. Eriette's Tempting Apple may be enough when on a Welder/Engineer package to have the redundancy to feel safe with that being a main combo ender and would replace Elixir of Immortality while potentially opening up other slots because of that.

You may also feel that you have enough outs to deal with situations where Grafdigger's Cage is the piece stopping you from potentially winning as Liquimetal Torque is a staple card that will not be leaving the deck any time soon that provides a way to combo through Grafdigger's Cage that does not introduce any potential "bloat."

You may also have enough win conditions already that adding Elixir of Immortality acts as combo line "bloat" rather than being efficient. Especially for decks on cards like Terror of the Peaks // Scourge of Valkas // Realm-Scorcher Hellkite

However Elixir of Immortality does add a plethora of lines for both combo starters and combo enders. It adds a layer of safety that may be more valuable than 1-2% win percentage similar to reasoning you might run Spine of Ish Sah regardless of the packages in your deck.
Goblin Welder//Goblin Engineer "Package"

Base Cards

Goblin Welder and Goblin Engineer normally go hand in hand however there are some lists that have opted to not use welder at certain points in time. The reason for this is that while Goblin Welder can act as a combo piece unless you are specifically needing to use a legendary artifact like Eriette's Tempting Apple you can just sidestep the problem and use Sculpting Steel if the artifact you need to use over and over is above 3 CMC.

Goblin Welder can make some interesting plays swapping opponent's artifacts to potentially take them off of consistent mana like Sol Ring or Mana Crypt and force the opponent to have temporary mana again if its already been used such as Jeweled Lotus or Lotus Petal

Goblin Engineer has a bit more value up front since it allows you to put something important into your graveyard to get back or alternatively put a Cursed Mirror into your graveyard so that it can be swapped the next turn to copy the existing Goblin Engineer but the new one has haste so it acts as a way to hide your true intention of what you're looking to put into play with the Cursed Mirror copy putting the actual target into your graveyard.

The combo lines these provide can be incredibly important if you are not on Elixir of Immortality however this sorta thing can easily be shut down by effects like Rest in Peace but thankfully these types of effects are extremely uncommon in CEDH.

One downside to these lines is that if for some reason you wish to build your deck around not having Maskwood Nexus for some reason then comboing off with these creatures require them to be played from hand and a draw loop to occur in order to obtain them which is not ideal.

These creatures also act as a way to remove problematic stax pieces that we play as long as there are things in our GY to allow us to do so. Things such as Null Rod and Grafdigger's Cage

Package Cards

    Cursed Mirror - This card is required, its one of the main ways you can give these creatures haste when its most important especially in combo scenarios with Liquimetal Torque or Mirror of the Forebears
    Elixir of Immortality - This can provide lines to remove our own Cursed Mirror and put it back into our deck to be used again for our combo.
    Eriette's Tempting Apple - Another way to primarily grant haste for combo routes, this is relatively important in builds not on Elixir of Immortality
    Jeweled Lotus - A piece that can be put right into the yard after being tutored out or low enough to be accessible with Goblin Engineer ETB
    Legion Extruder - Combo piece that lets you win the game through Grafdigger's Cage similar to Eriette's Tempting Apple and Twinshot Sniper if Welder/Engineer are on field already.
    Lotus Petal - A piece that can be put right into the yard after being tutored out or low enough to be accessible with Goblin Engineer ETB
    Maskwood Nexus - This is required if you want to have these combo lines as a main means of ending games as Goblin Welder and Goblin Engineer are not tutorable without this.
    Mirror Of The Forebears - This is a backup to Liquimetal Torque as a means of providing an artifact copy of these creatures.
    Sculpting Steel - Important combo piece for many lines, also can make a copy of an existing Cursed Mirror to give haste if necessary since it will get the mirror ETB.
    Spine of Ish Sah - Potential combo piece that is just generic removal.
    Tangle Wire - As long as you can put this in your graveyard after the counters are gone its always a strong target to be brought back and keep a potential stranglehold on opponents resources.
    The One Ring - The main way we draw loop now that things like Soul-Guide Latnern and Pyrite Spellbomb don't really see play.
    Twinshot Sniper - One of the main combo lines for ending the game with welder that provides extra value when in hand with it's channel ability.

Example Package Used In Actual Deck

Goblin Welder + Goblin Engineer + Elixir of Immortality + Cursed Mirror + Sculpting Steel + Spine of Ish Sah + Maskwood Nexus + Lotus Petal + Mirror of the Forebears + Twinshot Sniper

Cards here being added to the deck that are not already considered "Staples"; Goblin Welder + Goblin Engineer + Elixir of Immortality + Spine of Ish Sah + Maskwood Nexus + Lotus Petal + Jewled Lotus + Mirror of the Forebears

This type of package provides a means of recursion via Goblin Welder, Goblin Engineer and Elixir of Immortality. It also provides redundancy for making Welder/Engineer into an artifact in Mirror of the Forebears while also being valuable in non-clock treasure generation lines via clone effects. Maskwood Nexus helps the clone lines since Xorn is often a requirement to go pseudo infinite while also providing a means of allowing Welder/Engineer to be tutored. Spine of Ish Sah gives you the ability to not only fight your way through a Grafdigger's Cage before starting the line but also can be used as a combo piece on top of providing a means of forcing your Cursed Mirror to the graveyard if you need haste since this package does not run Eriette's Tempting Apple. Jeweled Lotus and Lotus Petal are simple ways to get an artifact to the bin if you are using Goblin Welder specifically for a combo line and also provide mana acceleration, they are also targets for the ETB from Goblin Engineer which can help when comboing off. The One Ring has a draw loop that will allow you to end the game in conjunction with Twinshot Sniper or you can simply use the combo loop to win with Twinshot Sniper itself or Sculpting Steel if using lines specifically with Goblin Engineer.

This would be the package you'd use if you were looking for the safety of Elixir of Immortality

Tertiary/Potential Overlap Card Example

Eriette's Tempting Apple

This card is needed if you are not on Spine of Ish Sah AND Elixir of Immortality while providing some very interesting combo lines in conjunction with Sculpting Steel.

While this does end games easily with Elixir of Immortality through Grafdigger's Cage there are also plenty of ways to remove cage if it is a problem especially if you are on Spine of Ish Sah.

So in the end you can say that while it is a tertiary piece to the specific package above it is a piece itself that generates a new package. That new package allows potentially removing Elixir of Immortality, Spine of Ish Sah and Twinshot Sniper though Twinshot Sniper is normally considered an important backup win condition if you're on Eriette's Tempting Apple since it can still provide a win through draw loops with The One Ring and wins through Rule of Law effects.

Why Might You Avoid This Card/Package Type

While I'd say close to 80% of decks are on Goblin Welder, Goblin Engineer or the pair of them they are not required.

If you want to play a build that does not really use Maskwood Nexus then Goblin Welder and Goblin Engineer provide very minimal value and can potentially save you many slots in your deck by doing so with some tradeoffs for the utility packages like these can provide many backup win conditions.

The decks that I have seen avoiding these types of packages are normally hard stax lists that are comfortable limiting their own potential win lines. They are more likely to be able to win through combat damage over time with flying beaters or through forcing a window to go off with their only real combo lines with Clock of Omens by making the gamestate as hard to play through as possible for their opponents.

They also tend to run a more streamlined approach of "Stax the game and give myself as many opportunities to have an artifact dwarf in play to limit the amount of tutors required to win the game."

An example of such a deck can be seen here in a video I've made highlighting Gruulstavo's list;

Null Rod "Package"

Base Cards Null Rod is a house of a card.

It interrupts so many game plans as mana rocks are an integral part of CEDH and there are also plenty of artifact abilities that also can cause some issues. This includes stopping our own "main" combo line in Clock of Omens.

One of the most important aspects of this card is the fact that it forces opponents to be unable to use treasures which run rampant in the format. This lets our own dockside generate a lot of value and potentially allows us to end games simply from opponents having and being unable to use any of their artifacts. Many players will play their own docksides with the idea that eventually the Null Rod will be removed and their treasures and artifacts will be unlocked, while that is true the risk versus reward needs to be taken into account.

While what this card can do is game warping it also warps how the deck needs to be built in order to make it's effect less impactful to ourselves. Not in that we can activate things through it, because we cannot but rather being able to still find ways to combo through it or out value our opponents over time through resource denial.

Package Cards Nullrod

    Abrade (Shatters) - If you are not on enough shatter effects it makes running this card very hard since our draw engines can be turned off with the exception of Professional Face-Breaker
    Battered Golem - "Barry" is a necessary evil in conjunction with Dwarven Bloodboiler to give a potential line through the Null Rod as you can still make infinite treasures with this combo if Maskwood Nexus is on field.
    Cavern-Hoard Dragon - The more artifacts that opponents have (treasure) the better this becomes. It is normally not reason enough to run this card but it certainly makes this dragon better than it otherwise might be.
    Dolmen Gate - This card is seldom seen but since our vehicles are shut down having a "risk free" way to attack into opponents can be quite appealing.
    Dwarven Bloodboiler - This is the second part required for the Battered Golem combo line that works through Null Rod
    Goblin Engineer - Being able to put things into the graveyard that can be swapped for the Null Rod at the most opportune time or as a way to get Null Rod into play is insane.
    Goblin Welder - Slightly worse than engineer in regards to interactions with Null Rod but if we've used anything that requires sacrifice like Lotus Petal or have had some other artifact removed it can still be quite helpful.
    Magda, the Hoardmaster - Infinite treasure outlet that functions through Null Rod. Requires Maskwood Nexus for consistency so it can be tutored.
    Maskwood Nexus - This is the only way to make the Battered Golem line work and allow us to tutor Dwarven Bloodboiler and Professional Face-Breaker which are both important.
    Plundering Barbarian - Shatter on a body, tutorable if Maskwood Nexus is in play.
    Professional Face-Breaker - This is a draw engine that works through Null Rod as its an ability of a creature and our treasures don't need to be tapped to activate it. This is an important part of finding a way to remove to the Null Rod if you don't have a way to win through it with how you built your deck.
    Roaming Throne - Gives us a secondary line with copy effects like Cursed Mirror, Sculpting Steel and Xorn to allow for us to make enough treasure to go off if we have a tap outlet.
    Scourge of Valkas - Win condition that works in conjunction with Maskwood Nexus to win through Null Rod
    Spine of Ish Sah - Catch all removal that you can get after making infinite treasures to remove Null Rod
    Terror of the Peaks - Win condition that works in conjunction with Maskwood Nexus to win through Null Rod
    Utvata Hellkite - Old school win condition that if left unchecked will take over games. Normally only used in heavy stax variants of the deck.

Example Package Used In Actual Deck

Null Rod + Goblin Engineer] + Battered Golem + Maskwood Nexus + Professional Face-Breaker + Plundering Barbarian + Dwarven Bloodboiler + Spine of Ish Sah + Roaming Throne

Cards here being added to the deck that are not already considered "Staples"; Null Rod, Goblin Engineer, Battered Golem, Maskwood Nexus, Dwarven Bloodboiler, Spine of Ish Sah

This package provides you with one of the best stax pieces in the current meta Null Rod, a way to generate infinite treasures through it in Battered Golem + Maskwood Nexus and Dwarven Bloodboiler. Maskwood Nexus being a part of this potentially give access to tutor Goblin Engineer, Plundering Barbarian and Professional Face-Breaker and Dwarven Bloodboiler] while Dwarven Bloodboiler also acts as a way to let us tap for treasures with the only downside being it costs 3 to cast. Professional Face-Breaker gives us the ability to find that out we need so badly post infinite treasures while Spine of Ish Sah potentially acts as a way to help us fight through multiple problems at once or remove the null rod entirely if we need access to our artifact activations for our win line such as with Clock of Omens. Roaming Throne provides that extra pivot point in conjunction with Xorn and Maskwood Nexus alongside ways to copy the creatures in this line to generate enough treasure per tapped creature to get every creature into play or enough to generate the extra treasures required to fight through our own Null Rod and win if we don't have access to Battered Golem easily or to bridge the gap to obtaining Battered Golem to actually "go infinite."

Tertiary/Potential Overlap Card Example

Blood Moon & Magus Of The Moon

Many decks will want to concede if one of these two pieces are out in conjunction with Null Rod since their decks simply cannot function. The 4+ color decks tend to not run basics, their treasures and mana rocks are turned off so they literally cannot participate in the game. Sometimes this is even true for 3 color decks, and some two color decks will greed and not run basics because they value their utility and mana-fixing lands too much.

Why Might You Avoid This Card/Package Type

While Null Rod is great and can suffocate some decks it stops us from activating our vehicles which is the main way we safely generate treasures. The current meta for CEDH has a lot of creatures that can block, so if you don't have access to open boards or Dwarven Bloodboiler this card can actively put you behind if your opponents do not play Dockside Extortionist to enable your own to potentially just win the game for you.

A majority of the pieces that are required to really get the most out of this card and play around it are Staples or Pseudo Staples. Because of this it overlaps with a few other packages and is only a single card so the downside might not be high to add this to your list, but sometimes the mental gymnastics you have to go through to fight your way out of a problem you created for yourself can be overwhelming.

Most decklist variants aren't on more than 3-4 shatters with one being a creature so lucking into an answer isn't always going to happen. Requiring 15 treasures to get your entire combo line through it is a tall task to accomplish more often than not and if you aren't able to remove it after putting together this combo either with a draw loop into a shatter or simply by using Spine of Ish Sah then a majority of deck variants have no way to win through it at least at instant speed since Magda, The Hoardmaster exists and still allows wins via combat damage.

So this card is only really usable if you're on a lot of packages with overlap and have access to as many outs as possible including things like Goblin Welder and Goblin Engineer otherwise you risk making boards states that are hard to dig yourself out of. Alternatively you can run lines that win specifically through Null Rod but those are few and far between and often require adding creatures you may not want to have in your decklist, but thankfully Magda, the Hoardmaster can provide a great outlet that also happens to be a Staple.

Even some hard stax decks do not run this card because of how game warping it can be to our normal play patterns that allow us to progress towards a win more safely and easily.

This card is back breaking for opponents though and if you're up to the task learning to play around it is quite rewarding as long as your deck can accommodate the requirements necessary.
