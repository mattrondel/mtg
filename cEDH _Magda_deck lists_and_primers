Magda is a proactive midrange combo deck, with both stax and fast combo pivots. This Treasure centric deck, 
focuses on high synergies between treasure 
generators such as dockside (and your friendly friends from under the mountain) to leverage Magda, 
Brazen Outlaw's ability to tutor and combo off for the win. This is usually done with Clock of Omen's 
and an artifact dwarf, or several of the other 2 card combos within the deck.
