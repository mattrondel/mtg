bootleg mage order 3/16 it takes 2 weeks to get hereso i figure i will forget why i got this stuff
at this time i was trying to determine what the staple are of most kian decks this and cvarious orders arond the time were these cards

when it arrives
sylvan libray one for sliver deck the other for kiann deck
finale of devisation one for squirreel deck one for kiann
force of negation kiann deck
gemstone caverns one kiann deck
dol amroth kiann deck and niv mizzet
Mox Opal SLD Etched Foil kiann deck 
Tezzeret the Seeker SLD  kiann deck 
4 one rings , kiaan, dwarf, chatterfang? and a spare
chrome mox  kiann deck 
Mana Confluence sliver deck? and kiann deck 
Valakut dwarf deck 
deflect swat dwarf deck and spare
command decon maybe dwarf deck i donno

kiann deck i dont know what direction to go with it but I know having the core staples is a good start, plan is to use mpc fill and bootleg mage to do it as cheap as possible and avoild the old over priced cards
