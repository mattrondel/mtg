Ebay misc

Only thing missing is a breeding pool but at this point I bought a Unfintiy in hopes of getting it but stupidly I overpaid Gamer hobo $120 when I could have paid the $20 for it , yeah this card costs 25.99 (I'm really dumb)

I feel extra stupid becuase am I getting the enjoymebnt out of spending this much $ ? not sure espesually since Mike has 98% the same deck
At this point I felt dumb and bought 5.99 for double sleeves to protect this stupidty, maybe I'll get luck aand this will become as expensive as my tolarian academy deck in the future but who knows



just ordered a bunch of cards for 
this deck the two references used 
for what was bought

this is the first reference 
not sure how to work the big dinosaur into it but 
play test it first
https://youtu.be/20rHhv8DjKM or https://youtu.be/-uaWt0ISBsg
3 botanical sanctums card kingdom and tcg, just got another one (both deck ideas call for 4)
trex ebay
omniscience ebay
growth spiral 4x ebay
2 black spells eBay and one second one from 
only item from the order that isnt this deck ia the narble tiral put him back into tempest set

i cant recall why i got the 4 growth spiral i think i read separately somewhere
i think it was an attempt to get the lotus cards out faster
DECK Changes suggestions from here: https://youtu.be/20rHhv8DjKM
add 1 Dig through time
remove 4 opt
add 2 wolfwillow haven
add 2 bala ged recovery 
remove a forest for one of the bala ged recovery
this is where things get different you can
remove 2 opt and add 2 wolfwillows
or remove 2 opt for ermgent ultimatum 
this really just preference 
add a blast zone
replace basic lands with botanical and bark channel
sideboard
anger of the gods from swelter suns




This was the second one mainly the heafty black spells
