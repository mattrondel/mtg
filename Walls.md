#### For sake of sanity maybe just get the different art works but not necessarily all printed copies (though it would be cool)
-Collection will be at least one of each card allowing for different art styles
#### Stick with the different versions i have so i can avoid getting alpha cards 
#### At least make place holders for these cards
#### Fun article https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Wall
#### Cross check bottom lists against https://www.tcgplayer.com/ and https://www.cardkingdom.com/
